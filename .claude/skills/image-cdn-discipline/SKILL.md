# Image CDN Discipline

How a multi-platform app serves a large image catalog without slow
grids, blurry detail views, or a bloated repo. Distilled from serving
~18,000 card images to iOS, Android, and web from Cloudflare R2 (BOBA
Playbook), including the measured production failure of the dev
domain.

## The two-tier layout

Publish every image at two sizes, under two prefixes:

| Tier | Size | Weight | Used by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `thumbs/{file}` | ~200px WebP | ~10 KB | every grid cell |
| `full/{file}` | ≤1200px WebP | ~80 KB | detail views, share images |

- **Grids never load `full/`.** A 3-column grid scrolling 10k items
  on thumbs is smooth; on full images it's a network and memory
  disaster.
- **Detail views show the thumb immediately while full loads behind
  it.** The thumb is already in cache from the grid the user just
  tapped — a blurry-then-sharp swap beats a spinner every time.
- **Grid cells constrain BOTH width and height before clipping.**
  A cell constrained on one axis lets an odd-aspect image blow the
  layout.
- **Verify the tier's actual resolution before building features on
  its claim.** One project's docs said `full/` was "≤1200px"; the
  real files ranged 477–745px, and a 3D feature that rendered them at
  1080×1920 shipped "thumbnail blown up" blur. When a rendering
  feature needs more pixels, the authoritative fix is regenerating
  the tier at higher resolution — perceptual masking (upscalers,
  sharpening) is a stopgap that hides the defect, not a fix.

## One URL helper per platform

**Never hardcode CDN URLs.** Each platform gets exactly one pair of
helpers — `thumbUrl(f)` / `fullUrl(f)` in `js/api.js`, `CDN.swift`,
`Cdn.kt` — and every image load routes through them. The payoff is
concrete: flipping the CDN base (dev domain → custom domain, bucket
migration, provider change) is a one-line change per platform instead
of a repo-wide grep-and-pray.

## Images never live in git

The repo carries JSON metadata only; image bytes live exclusively on
the CDN. Reasons: clone speed, host storage caps (GitHub's soft 1 GB
limit), and the fact that images have their own lifecycle (re-
optimization, re-sourcing) that shouldn't churn git history. If the
optimizer needs source masters, they live on the maintainer's machine
or object storage — documented, not committed.

## The dev-domain trap (measured)

Provider dev/preview domains (e.g. `*.r2.dev`) are **rate-limited and
weakly cached by design** — they're documented as not-for-production,
and the docs mean it. Measured on a real catalog: 9 KB thumbnails took
**6.8–9.6 s on edge-cache misses** vs ~0.2 s on hits, with no cache
headers at all. With a large catalog, the long tail of rarely-viewed
images is *perpetual misses* — deep-catalog browsing crawls on every
platform and no client-side fix can help.

- Production requires a **custom domain attached to the CDN zone** so
  real edge caching applies. (For R2 that means the zone must be on
  Cloudflare DNS — check the nameserver prerequisite early; it can be
  the actual blocker.)
- **Do the domain move BEFORE any bulk asset regeneration**, so the
  new bytes land behind a real cache instead of warming a domain
  you're about to abandon.
- Client-side amplifiers (eager loading, main-thread decode,
  per-render full-catalog filters) make CDN latency look worse — fix
  them too, but don't mistake them for the root cause. Instrument and
  measure a cache miss directly before concluding.

## Trust the asset reference, not a flag

If a record has a non-empty asset field, load it — even when a
redundant `imageAvailable`-style boolean says false. Real catalogs
ship records with stale availability flags alongside perfectly valid
assets; gating on the flag hides good images. Let the CDN 404
gracefully for the truly-missing and show the placeholder then.

## Image-first sorting

**Every list and grid sorts items WITH images ahead of image-pending
placeholders** — as the primary sort key, on every surface. A wall of
placeholders at the top of a grid reads as "the app is broken," even
at 90% coverage. Coverage gaps belong at the bottom, where the user
scrolls into them already trusting the catalog.

## Client cache sizing

Defaults are sized for apps with a handful of images, not catalogs.
Configure deliberately at launch:

- **iOS**: `URLCache` ~100 MB memory / ~500 MB disk, shared by every
  image request path (including any `AsyncImage` session override).
- **Android**: Coil memory (~60 MB) + disk (~500 MB) caches sized to
  match the iOS budget, on the shared OkHttp client.
- **Web**: the browser handles it — but only if the CDN sends real
  cache headers, which is the custom-domain point above.

# iOS Production Gotchas

The cross-cutting lessons from shipping four iOS apps to the App
Store. The vendored framework skills (swiftui-*, avkit, etc.) carry
API depth; this skill carries the **bugs that cost multi-iteration
debugging sessions** and their one-line fixes — check here FIRST when
a symptom matches.

## Presentation + navigation

- **`fullScreenCover(item:)` / `sheet(item:)` — never
  `isPresented:` + the payload in separate `@State`.** The two-state
  version races: the cover renders before the payload lands → an
  empty/black modal, intermittently. (A real bug chased through
  files, encodings, and URLs before the race was found; `item:` is
  atomic.)
- **`.matchedTransitionSource` must be the OUTERMOST modifier** on
  the source view, and `.navigationTransition(.zoom(...))` used
  exactly as documented. 10+ iterations of layout artifacts
  ("forehead bug") came from modifier-order drift.
- One destination registry (a single shared `navigationDestination`
  modifier all stacks apply), router-owned `NavigationPath` per tab,
  external entry points through an intent inbox — see CLAUDE.md;
  per-view destinations are how "this screen can't push that screen"
  bugs are born.
- Settings is a sheet behind a toolbar gear, not a tab — tab bars
  are for content verbs.
- **A modal presented from inside an iPad popover silently no-ops.**
  A sheet that adapts via `.presentationCompactAdaptation(.popover)`
  on iPad must never itself present another sheet or
  `fullScreenCover` — the nested presentation does nothing, with no
  error. A Profile surface that was a popover on iPad made "Sign In"
  a dead button → **App Store rejection 2.1(a)**. Rule: popover
  adaptation is for LEAF surfaces only (filter panels, pickers,
  single-action menus); any surface that re-presents stays a plain
  `.sheet` on every size class.
- **Chained presentations need `onDismiss:`, not sleep.** Opening a
  sheet right after a `fullScreenCover` dismisses requires
  `.fullScreenCover(... onDismiss:)` to sequence the second
  presentation — `Task.sleep` delays race and fail intermittently.
- **A toolbar `Button` gets an unsuppressable rounded-rect highlight**
  (`UIButtonConfiguration`, iOS 15+) that no SwiftUI modifier or
  legacy appearance API removes. If the design forbids it, use a
  plain view + `.onTapGesture` (→ `UIBarButtonItem(customView:)`,
  never configured), and restore accessibility with
  `.accessibilityLabel` + `.accessibilityAddTraits(.isButton)`.

## The dark-mode legibility trap

A single `AccentColor` tuned for light mode (e.g. a deep blue) makes
**bordered buttons, links, and Sign-in buttons unreadable under
forced dark appearance** — and you won't see it because you test in
one appearance. Fixes:

- Give `AccentColor` a **dark-appearance variant** in the asset
  catalog (lighter/brighter twin of the brand accent).
- Use Apple's own button styles for sign-in (white Sign in with
  Apple button on dark) — a custom-styled SiwA button that's
  unreadable means users never sign in, and you'll chase "sync
  doesn't work" instead of the real bug (this happened).
- Audit every `.bordered`/`.borderedProminent` surface in BOTH
  appearances before shipping.

## Layout traps

- **Never put a fill-mode image (`.scaledToFill`) inside
  `frame(maxWidth: .infinity)`** — the frame ADOPTS the image's
  oversized cover dimensions and blows the layout off both screen
  edges, intermittently (depends which artwork variant loads).
  Ambient/hero art goes in `.background` + `.clipped()`, which
  cannot influence layout.
- **Detail heroes FIT, never fill** — an explicit-height
  aspect-fit poster (rounded + shadow) over a blurred ambient
  backdrop beats a fill-crop that beheads the artwork. Request
  larger image variants for the hero only (grid-size elsewhere).
- **Adaptivity via `@Environment(\.horizontalSizeClass)`, never
  `UIDevice` checks**; one `TabView(.sidebarAdaptable)` hierarchy
  serves iPhone + iPad — no parallel `NavigationSplitView` code
  path.

## State + rendering

- **A custom `Equatable` on view-model types must include EVERY
  property that affects rendering.** Excluding "noisy" fields
  (e.g. a node's position) means SwiftUI skips re-renders when only
  that field changes — the state updates, the screen doesn't, and it
  looks like an animation bug. (16 iterations on a graph view before
  instrumentation exposed the state/render mismatch.)
- When repeated fixes don't change a symptom, **instrument before
  iterating** — print the state you believe vs the state that
  renders. The divergence point is the bug (CLAUDE.md debugging
  philosophy; it has paid off every time).
- **First-frame data must load synchronously in the initializer.**
  Wrapping the initial catalog/content load in `Task {}` queues it
  behind SwiftUI's first render pass — a ~10 s blank screen before
  any content. Load a small bundled head synchronously; hydrate the
  rest async.
- **Benchmark a serializer before using it as a cache.** One standard
  encoder took 20–30 s over ~12k structs; plain `JSONDecoder` on a
  bundled file took 1–3 s — the "obvious" caching layer was 10×
  slower than not caching.
- **`TimelineView(.animation)` is expensive** — wrap it conditionally
  on the animating state (`if state.pending != nil`) so dozens of
  static tiles don't re-evaluate every frame.
- **`ImageRenderer` captures `.current` state, not interpolated
  animation** — SwiftUI's `withAnimation` interpolation lives in the
  GPU layer. When rendering an animated frame stream, drive values
  from a time function, never from animated `@State`.
- **A `let x: T = switch …` expression inside a SwiftUI body with
  several locals reliably times out the type checker.** Extract the
  switch into a function.
- Auth: Keychain for credentials; silent re-auth on launch and on
  `scenePhase == .active` (the visibilitychange analog) before the
  first authenticated call — not on a timer.
- **When SwiftUI gestures need immediate touch delivery** (a canvas,
  a physics graph, anything where taps/drags "need a warm-up" before
  firing): SwiftUI `DragGesture`/`TapGesture` and even a `UIView`
  `touchesBegan` override are delayed by `_UIHostingView`'s
  `delaysTouchesBegan`. The structurally immune pattern is a custom
  `UIGestureRecognizer` **subclass** whose own
  `touchesBegan/Moved/Ended` overrides do the work — recognizer touch
  methods are dispatched by the gesture system before responder-chain
  delivery. Keep it passive (`cancelsTouchesInView = false`,
  `canPrevent`/`canBePrevented` return false, reset to `.failed` at
  sequence end) and pass `view.bounds.size` to callbacks so callers
  never need a possibly-stale `GeometryProxy`. Extract the routing
  math into a platform-free type so it's unit-testable (Decision
  042).
- **Never put a SwiftUI gesture overlay in a ZStack ABOVE a
  `UIScrollView`-backed view** (a zoomable image, a scrolling
  canvas) — the two gesture systems deadlock and one side goes dead.
  When a surface needs both scroll/zoom AND custom gestures, build
  the whole surface in UIKit and pass touches through with a
  `hitTest` override returning `nil` for regions the overlay doesn't
  own. (A crop view took 5 iterations of fighting SwiftUI gestures
  before the UIKit rebuild fixed it in one.)
- **In `@Observable` stores, every mutation of a source array must
  also rebuild any DERIVED array the UI renders from.** Mutating
  `items[i]` in place while a view renders from `filteredItems`
  shows stale data with no error — a staleness bug that was four
  layers deep before the derived-array rule was found. Centralize
  mutations in one store method that rebuilds the derivatives.
- **Project-wide MainActor default isolation**
  (`SWIFT_DEFAULT_ACTOR_ISOLATION = MainActor`) makes every class
  implicitly `@MainActor` — classes receiving framework callbacks
  off-main (capture pipelines, network listeners) need explicit
  `nonisolated` at the class level, and `Task {}` stays on the main
  actor (use `Task.detached` to actually reach a background thread).
- **Network.framework callback classes under Swift 6 strict
  concurrency**: a `nonisolated final class` marked
  `@unchecked Sendable` with an `NSLock`-protected cache, bridging
  to MainActor state separately — `NWListener`/`NWConnection`
  callbacks cannot land on a MainActor-isolated type.

## Image loading in high-churn lists

- **`AsyncImage` in a `LazyVStack`/`LazyVGrid` shows the WRONG image
  in recycled cells**: an in-flight load lands after the cell was
  reassigned to a different item. Any cached loader must **re-check
  the bound URL after the await** and discard a mismatched result —
  that one check kills the bug class.
- `AsyncImage` also decodes full-resolution on the main thread —
  scroll hitches and memory spikes in feed/gallery surfaces. Use a
  small shared loader: `NSCache` (e.g. 600 items / 60 MB) +
  **off-main ImageIO downsampling to display size**
  (`kCGImageSourceCreateThumbnailFromImageAlways` +
  `kCGImageSourceThumbnailMaxPixelSize`). Keep `AsyncImage` for
  low-churn one-offs.
- This complements — not replaces — the launch-configured big
  `URLCache` (transport layer). Expose the decoded-cache's
  `clearCache()` behind a Settings action.

## Resilience wiring

- **Connectivity**: one `@Observable` monitor wrapping a single
  `NWPathMonitor` on a background queue, injected via
  `@Environment`. Views use it to show the offline banner and keep
  cached content visible — offline must be distinguishable from "the
  server failed", or users see a retry button that cannot succeed
  (`universal-feature-states`).
- **SwiftData `ModelContainer` creation goes in `do/catch` with an
  in-memory fallback.** A corrupt or migration-incompatible on-disk
  store otherwise crashes every launch with no recovery path short
  of reinstalling. Losing one session of persistence is acceptable;
  a launch-blocking trap never is.
- SwiftData lightweight-migration trap: a property added to an
  existing `@Model` needs an **inline default at the declaration**
  (`var kind: String = "default"`) or existing stores crash on open.

## Haptics: a semantic taxonomy, not ad-hoc generators

Define one `Haptics` enum with semantic cases and call ONLY those:
`selection` (paging, toggles, tab changes), `light`/`medium`/`heavy`
(discrete actions by weight), `success`/`warning`/`error` (operation
outcomes). Scattered `UIImpactFeedbackGenerator(style:)` calls drift
— the same event ends up with different feedback in different views,
and feedback gets sprinkled as noise. Two binding pairings: `error`
always accompanies a surfaced error banner; `selection` always
accompanies a page/segment change. Pick the meaning, not the
generator; prefer `.sensoryFeedback(_:trigger:)` as the call site
where it fits (`native-platform-first`).

## Build system: the synchronized-group new-file gotcha

Projects using file-system-synchronized groups
(`PBXFileSystemSynchronizedRootGroup`) **intermittently fail to
compile brand-new standalone `.swift` files** — "cannot find X in
scope" persists through clean builds and a DerivedData wipe while the
file plainly exists on disk. Mitigation: **inline new types into an
already-compiled file** (the app-store file, the design-system file)
instead of creating a new `.swift` file; if a new file is
unavoidable, verify it compiles into the target before building
anything on top of it. New **asset-catalog** entries (colorsets,
imagesets) are processed by `actool` regardless — new assets are
safe.

## Media + background

- `AVAudioSession` category `.playback` set before play — without
  it, audio dies on silent-switch/lock and PiP behaves oddly.
- **Background audio**: `audio` in `UIBackgroundModes`, then the
  supported AVKit technique — make the player-VC coordinator an
  `AVPlayerViewControllerDelegate`, **detach `vc.player` on
  `didEnterBackground`** (audio keeps running on the session) and
  **reattach on `willEnterForeground`**. Make it **PiP-aware**: skip
  the detach while PiP owns the video (track PiP via delegate
  callbacks); the PiP restore handler completes `true` when the
  full-screen player stays in the hierarchy.
- PiP: `allowsPictureInPicturePlayback = true`; auto-PiP from inline
  needs `canStartPictureInPictureAutomaticallyFromInline`.
- Create a fresh `AVPlayer` at the resume timecode per presentation
  — don't pass live players between views.
- **SwiftUI animations crash AVKit**: an inline video view inside an
  animated layout change (a reply box opening, a row expanding)
  crashes because `AVPlayerLayer` rejects implicit CoreAnimation
  frame animations. Apply `.transaction { $0.animation = nil }` to
  the video view to block animation propagation into it.
- **Inline → fullscreen video: present `AVPlayerViewController` via
  UIKit `present(_:animated:completion:)`**, with a fresh player at
  the current seek position and `player.play()` in the completion.
  Wrapping it in a SwiftUI `fullScreenCover` produces a
  double-fullscreen layer with no dismiss path.
- One shared `AVPlayer` for a paged full-screen video feed
  (TikTok-style): `replaceCurrentItem` on page change, briefly muted
  (~400 ms) to hide the buffer-prime audio pop; page cells size with
  `.containerRelativeFrame([.horizontal, .vertical])`, not
  `GeometryReader` (unreliable inside a `NavigationStack`).
- Streaming from flaky hosts: `resilient-media-streaming`.

## Camera + capture

- **`UIImagePickerController` is broken on multi-camera iPhones**
  (camera contention on triple-lens devices). Use `AVCaptureSession`
  + `AVCapturePhotoOutput` pinned to `.builtInWideAngleCamera`.
- **Correct EXIF orientation before Vision/CIImage** — a captured
  `UIImage`'s pixels are sideways relative to its orientation
  metadata; run an orientation-normalize pass first or OCR/detection
  reads rotated garbage.
- Recognition pipelines (OCR + fingerprint matching, CLI mirror
  harnesses, confidence gates): `camera-recognition-pipeline`.

## Verification recipes

- Sim screenshots: `xcrun simctl io booted screenshot shot.png`;
  drive the app to a known screen with launch-env hooks
  (`SIMCTL_CHILD_APP_START_ITEM=… xcrun simctl launch …` — Decision
  018); cold start needs ~20–25 s before the shot.
- Boot ONE simulator at a time (parallel boots wedge in "Waiting on
  System App").
- The simulator lies about: filesystem permissions (tvOS), real
  network conditions, background-mode behavior, and CloudKit
  environment — those four classes need a device check before
  "done."
- After touching any shared `Core/` file in the universal target,
  build BOTH destinations (`-destination 'platform=iOS Simulator…'`
  and `platform=tvOS Simulator…`).
- SourceKit phantom "Cannot find X in scope" across files = stale
  index; trust `xcodebuild`. `@Query` macro views can cascade these.

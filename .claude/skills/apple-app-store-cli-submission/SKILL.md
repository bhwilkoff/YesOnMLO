description: REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION (Archive Watch) behind the generic `cloud-appstore-submission` skill — consult AFTER it for the local-CLI pathway and its traps. Build + upload Archive Watch's macOS/iOS/tvOS App Store builds from the command line (no Xcode GUI) — the manual-REST-signing pathway, the ITMS-90111 Xcode-floor trap, the PyJWT venv, per-platform SDK downloads, the tuple-sort type-check gotcha, and screenshots. Invoke before archiving, signing, submitting, or resubmitting any Apple build, or when App Review rejects a build for SDK/Xcode/signing reasons.

# Apple App Store submission (CLI) — Archive Watch

Runbook: `docs/CLOUD-SUBMISSION.md`. Live state + cert ids:
`mac_app_store_build_pathway` memory. All three Apple apps share ONE App Store
Connect record (bundle id `com.example.appname`, Decision 042). Android is a
separate path (`tools/submit-play.sh`, Play Developer API).

## PRIMARY PATH — build in the cloud (the dev Mac is on a BETA macOS)

Local builds are REJECTED (ITMS-90301, rule 2) because the dev Mac runs a beta macOS.
**Build in the cloud instead:**
```
# bump AppVersion.xcconfig (patch + build) and PUSH first — the runner builds the committed version
gh workflow run appstore-build.yml -f platform=all     # or mac | ios | tvos
```
`.github/workflows/appstore-build.yml` runs on a GitHub-hosted **`macos-26`** runner
(RELEASED macOS + Xcode 26.6 → clears both ITMS-90301 and ITMS-90111), FREE for this
public repo. It imports the signing `.p12`s from repo secrets into a temp keychain and
runs `tools/submit-appstore.sh` with `ASC_DIST_CERT_ID`. Validated 2026-06-30 (all three
at 1.3.249/771). Then the OWNER selects the build in ASC → Submit for Review.

**Re-seeding the signing secrets** (one-time, or if a CI cert changes):
`tools/ci_make_signing_p12.py <distribution|mac_installer> out.p12 <pw>` mints a dedicated
cert via the ASC API and bundles it into a **`-legacy`-PBE** `.p12` (macOS `security import`
can't read OpenSSL-3 default AES-256 PBE), then `gh secret set APPLE_DIST_P12` (base64,
single-line) etc. CI certs: dist `87TU7L3TBQ`, installer `K8QX4BXZZL`. Apple Distribution
is capped at 2 certs — reuse, don't keep minting.

## The local command (only on a RELEASED-macOS machine)

```
DEVELOPER_DIR=<released-Xcode>/Contents/Developer tools/submit-appstore.sh <mac|ios|tvos|all>
```
It archives → resolves embedded bundle ids → ensures certs → creates an App Store
profile per bundle id → writes a manual ExportOptions → exports + uploads via the
ASC API key. Re-running is safe. **Rejected ITMS-90301 if the build machine is on a beta
macOS** — use the cloud path above. The OWNER selects the build in ASC and hits Submit.

## Load-bearing rules (each cost real time to learn)

1. **Manual signing is REQUIRED — cloud/automatic signing FAILS for this team key**
   ("Cloud signing permission error" / "No profiles for com.example.appname"),
   even though the key CAN create certs/profiles via REST. The script signs
   manually: `asc_certs.py` (Apple Distribution + Mac Installer certs) +
   `asc_profiles.py` (a profile per bundle id). Don't "simplify" it to automatic.

2. **Two post-upload rejections gate every local build — CHECK BOTH BEFORE building:**
   - **ITMS-90111 (Xcode/SDK floor, recurring).** The Xcode/SDK is older than Apple's
     current floor. Diagnose: `WebFetch https://developer.apple.com/news/releases` for
     the latest **released/RC** Xcode (a build number ending in a lowercase letter, e.g.
     `27A5194q`, is a BETA — rejected), compare to `xcodebuild -version`; owner installs
     it (`xcodes install <ver>`, Apple ID + 2FA, not headless), rebuild all three at a
     fresh build. (First hit 2026-06-30: 26.0 → 26.6.)
   - **ITMS-90301 ("not accepting applications built with this version of the OS") = the
     build MACHINE is on a BETA macOS.** A GA Xcode does NOT help — Apple rejects ANY
     App Store build made on a beta OS. Check `sw_vers` (a BuildVersion ending in a
     lowercase letter, e.g. `26A5353q`, or `ProductVersion` of an unreleased macOS, is a
     beta) or `BuildMachineOSBuild` in the archive's app Info.plist. **You cannot fix
     this by rebuilding on a beta box — don't try.** Build on a RELEASED macOS instead.
     (Hit 2026-06-30: the dev Mac is on macOS 27 beta `26A5353q`.)
   - **Both vanish with Xcode Cloud** (Apple's runners = released macOS + released Xcode;
     `ci_scripts/ci_post_clone.sh` already exists). It's the standing recommendation when
     the local box is on a beta OS or chasing the Xcode floor. **TestFlight still accepts
     beta-OS / beta-built binaries** — only App Store *review* is gated, so testing isn't
     blocked.

3. **PyJWT dependency self-heals.** `asc_certs.py`/`asc_profiles.py` sign the ASC JWT
   with `import jwt` (PyJWT) + cryptography. Homebrew python3 is PEP-668 and lacks
   them; the script now auto-provisions `tools/.asc-venv` and runs the cert tools
   from it. If you bypass the script, put a jwt-capable python on PATH first.

4. **Per-platform device SDKs + Metal are separate Xcode component downloads.** A
   fresh Xcode needs `-downloadComponent MetalToolchain` (~700 MB; the app has a
   `.metal` shader — the script auto-installs it) and may need
   `xcodebuild -downloadPlatform iOS`/`tvOS` if the "Any iOS/tvOS Device"
   destination shows "not installed". (Xcode `.xip` GA installs usually bundle them.)

5. **Released Xcode only — never beta for review.** The code carries
   `#if compiler(>=6.4)` guards so macOS/iOS/tvOS-27 symbols compile on BOTH the
   GA toolchain (uses the `#else` 26 API) and the beta. Any NEW 27-only symbol must
   be `#if compiler(>=6.4)`-guarded, NOT just `#available` (a runtime check still
   needs the symbol in the BUILD SDK → fails to COMPILE on GA). Audit:
   `grep -rn 'available((macOS|iOS|tvOS) 27'`.

6. **tvOS tuple-sort type-check timeout.** `.sorted { (a,b,c) > (a,b,c) }` tuple
   comparisons "unable to type-check in reasonable time" on the GA toolchain (build
   fine on beta's newer Swift). Compare field-by-field. tvOS-only files surface this
   (iOS/macOS don't compile them). Fix wherever a new type-check timeout appears.

## Credentials & secrets (configured)

- ASC API key (TEAM key): ID `G5549XF8RV`, issuer `69a6de74-3929-47e3-e053-5b8c7c11a4d1`,
  `.p8` at `~/.appstoreconnect/private_keys/` (OUTSIDE the repo). IDs in gitignored
  `tools/asc-credentials.env` (sourced by the script). Individual keys 401.
- Existing cert ids: Apple Distribution `7VDL7K5H79`, 3rd Party Mac Installer
  `T445JWG853` (reused find-first; created+imported only if absent).
- Bundle ids embedded: iOS = main + `.widgets`; tvOS = main + `.topshelf`; macOS =
  main only. `.ipa` exports take no installer cert; the macOS `.pkg` does.
- **Bump BOTH `MARKETING_VERSION` + `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` in AppVersion.xcconfig
  every build** — App Review burns a build number even on rejection; the next must be
  ahead. Build numbers can differ per platform but we keep them aligned.

## Disk (the box runs ~97% full)

A fresh Xcode needs ~25-30 GB. Free it: delete the obsolete Xcode app, clear
`~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/*`, `build/*.xcarchive build/*-export`
between platforms. Don't delete an Xcode app without owner OK (hard to reverse).

## Screenshots

macOS: 16:10, EXACTLY 1280×800 / 1440×900 / 2560×1600 / **2880×1800**. Drive the
app via `AW_START_TAB` / `AW_START_ITEM` / `AW_CS_TEST` launch hooks; capture by
REGION from the AX window bounds (SwiftUI exposes no AXWindowNumber) then PIL-frame
to exact size — `tools/mac-shotset.sh <app>` runs the whole set. Needs Screen
Recording permission. Any build may produce screenshots (not the submitted binary).

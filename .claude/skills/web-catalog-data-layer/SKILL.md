description: Use when touching the web viewer's data access (/watch/), adding a web feature that needs catalog data, or considering SQLite-over-HTTP for the browser. Captures the verified CORS/Range matrix and the shipped index + metadata-API pattern (Decision 029) so it isn't re-derived or violated.

# Web catalog data layer

## The verified host matrix (measured 2026-06-09 — re-verify only if a host changes)

| Host | Ranged GET | CORS for `fetch()` | Usable from browser JS? |
|---|---|---|---|
| GitHub Pages (`<your-pages-domain>`) | **206** | **yes `*`** | ✅ the only fetchable catalog host |
| GitHub Release assets | 206 | none | ❌ (native apps only) |
| `archive.org/download/*` (storage nodes) | 206 | none | ❌ for fetch; ✅ for `<img>`/`<video>` (elements skip CORS) |
| `archive.org/metadata/*`, scrape API | — | yes `*` | ✅ |

Pitfall that created this skill: a 2026-06-02 measurement said Pages "doesn't
do 206" — it was a **HEAD-request artifact**. Range works on GET.

## The shipped pattern (Decision 029, WEB-DESIGN §2)

- Browse/search: `catalog-index.json` (Pages, ~5.4 MB, popularity-sorted
  tuples `[id, title, year, contentType, poster]` + a top-level `shelves`
  map, schema 3 — handle shorter older rows; built by
  `a build_catalog_index-style script (example in Archive Watch; not shipped here)`).
- Shelves: the index's editorial `shelves` map (the apps' item_shelves
  analog), cross-shelf deduped + day-seed rotated client-side. **Never the
  live scrape API for consumer surfaces** — audited 2026-06-10: scrape
  bypassed the rights audit + adult filter AND returned one identical list
  for every `-downloads` shelf (WEB-DESIGN §2.3).
- Detail/playback: `archive.org/metadata/{id}` via `js/api.js`
  (`API.fetchMetadata` + `API.summarize` picks the playable derivative —
  keep in sync with Swift `DerivativePicker`).
- Posters: index poster column → `archive.org/services/img/{id}` fallback.
- Never `fetch()` Release assets or `archive.org/download/*` from the
  browser. Never commit a SQLite to git for Pages (Decision 018).

## The upgrade path (when FTS5 / enriched detail / Channels reach web)

Chunked slim `catalog.sqlite` deployed to Pages **via GitHub Actions**
(`actions/upload-pages-artifact` — nothing committed), queried with
`sql.js-httpvfs` + OPFS cache. Requires the owner to flip Settings → Pages →
Source: GitHub Actions and a deploy job in `publish-db.yml`. Until that
lands, the index is the only catalog the browser loads.

# Play CLI Submission

Ship an Android App Bundle to Google Play entirely from the CLI, via the **Play Developer API v3**. Pairs with `store-submission-playbook` (listing / Data Safety / screenshots) and `android-production-gotchas` (building the signed AAB) — this skill is the **upload+release transaction** and its auth gotchas.

## When to invoke

- Uploading a signed AAB to any Play track (internal / closed / production) from the command line
- Setting up service-account auth for automated Play publishing
- Play rejects a version code, or an SA key can't be created

## Rule 1 — Publishing is one "edits" transaction

The Play Developer API v3 is transactional: **insert an edit** (get an edit-id) → **upload the AAB** to that edit → **assign it to a track** with release notes and status → **commit** the edit. Nothing is live until commit; a validation failure aborts the whole edit cleanly (no partial release). The shipped driver `tools/submit-play.sh` → `tools/play-publish.py` runs exactly this sequence.

## Rule 2 — Service-account JSON auth, scope androidpublisher

Auth is a **service-account JSON key** (from a GCP project) with the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/androidpublisher` scope, and that service account **granted access in the Play Console** (Users & permissions → invite the SA email → release permissions). No OAuth user flow, no interactive login — the SA key is the whole credential. Keep it out of git (`~/.config/…` or a CI secret).

## Rule 3 — versionCode +1 on EVERY upload

Bump `versionCode` for every single AAB you upload. **Why**: Play permanently rejects any `versionCode` it has seen before — **even one uploaded to a draft/unreleased track and never shipped**. There is no reuse. Keep `versionName` in lockstep with the app's marketing version across platforms; `versionCode` is a monotonic integer that only ever increments.

## Rule 4 — applicationId ≠ namespace

The `applicationId` (the immutable Play identity of the app) is independent of the Gradle `namespace` (the R/BuildConfig package). Set `applicationId` deliberately and never change it after first publish — it IS the app on Play. The `namespace` can differ and can be refactored freely.

## Rule 5 — Staged rollout via track status + fraction

A release on a track carries a status: `draft` (staged, not live), `inProgress` + a `userFraction` (e.g. 0.1 = 10% staged rollout), or `completed` (100%). Ramp by editing the fraction on subsequent edits; promote by moving the same AAB to a higher track. Pass the target track + status + notes through the publish script rather than hardcoding.

## Rule 6 — The org-policy key-block gotcha

Creating a service-account **key** under a Google Workspace / organization-owned GCP project can hit an **IAM org-policy block** (`iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation`) — the key create is refused outright. Fix: create the GCP project AND the service account under a **personal gmail** (no org attached, so no key policy) via `gcloud`:

```
gcloud projects create …            # personal account, no org
gcloud iam service-accounts create …
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create key.json --iam-account …
```

Then invite that SA's email into the Play Console. **Eventual-consistency retry**: a freshly-created SA sometimes isn't yet visible to the key-create call — retry key creation a few times with backoff before treating it as a real failure. Full walkthrough in `docs/store/play-api-key-setup.md`.

## Rule 7 — A committed edit can still stall in the Console

The edits transaction ends at Play's REVIEW layer, not at "live". Two
Console states have cost real releases: a changes bar reading **"refused to
auto-submit"** (or a stuck "N changes") means those changes will NEVER
process until acted on — it is a stall, not a queue; and **"Submit N
changes" is all-or-nothing** — every pending Console edit rides the same
submit, so read what the N contains first. After any CLI publish, confirm
the Console shows the release in review/live, not sitting behind a changes
bar. (The Windows twin of this lesson — the `commit=true` and
publishing-hold stalls — is in `docs/windows/WINDOWS-STORE-SUBMISSION.md`.)

## Rule 8 — The pre-launch report is Firebase Test Lab; run it yourself

The internal track generates NO pre-launch report, so the first automated
device pass otherwise happens AFTER promotion — too late. The report is
just Firebase Test Lab: run `tools/testlab-android.sh` against the release
AAB before promoting. **Physical devices only** — emulators cannot see Play
Billing, so billing-at-startup crashes (Decision 039's mixed-list throw)
pass every emulator and fail on every real phone.

## Rule 9 — Native debug symbols travel INSIDE the AAB

Play's "missing debug symbols" warning (from pre-stripped dependency
`.so` files — ML Kit and friends) cannot be reliably cleared by
uploading `native-debug-symbols.zip`: the API route
(`edits.deobfuscationfiles.upload`) is blocked for some accounts and
the Console UI upload doesn't dependably take. Embed instead: a
Gradle task injects each `.so` as
`BUNDLE-METADATA/com.android.tools.build.debugsymbols/<abi>/<lib>.so.dbg`
and re-signs with the upload key. **Use `zip -D`** — a directory zip
entry inside an AAB surfaces as a misleading "invalid signature"
rejection. Full recipe: `android-production-gotchas` §Release
engineering.

## Scaffolding shipped

- `tools/submit-play.sh` — the CLI entry point
- `tools/play-publish.py` — the edits-transaction driver (insert → upload → track → commit)
- `tools/testlab-android.sh` — the self-run pre-launch report (Firebase Test Lab, physical devices)
- `docs/store/play-api-key-setup.md` — SA key setup + the org-policy workaround

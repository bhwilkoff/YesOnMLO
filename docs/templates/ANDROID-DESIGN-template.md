# [APP NAME] — Android Design (BINDING)

<!-- Seed for docs/ANDROID-DESIGN.md. Invoke
     `binding-design-doc-discipline` for the workflow and
     `android-production-gotchas` for the mechanics this doc does NOT
     restate (dbVersion invalidation keying, BundledSQLiteDriver, the
     staged atomic DB swap, the contradictory-WHERE silent-empty bug,
     sealed-Route nav + deep-link inbox, Media3 queue flags, emulator
     verification).

     The §N structure and the rules baked in below are ANDROID platform
     facts — true for any Compose app on this template's shared data
     plane. Keep them. Replace every [BRACKET]; delete the <!-- FILL -->
     notes. Sections marked "(optional module)" apply only if the app
     has that surface. When a rule inverts an iOS/tvOS rule, that
     inversion is deliberate (the Material idiom of the same verb). -->

**Binding.** Quote the rule number before proposing any new screen,
route, sheet, or data path in the Android app (`android/`). If no rule
fits, propose a NEW rule first. Companion to `PARITY.md`,
`docs/DATA-CONTRACT.md`, and the sibling design docs — the platforms
share verbs, never idioms (PARITY "same verb, native idiom").

## §1 Principles

- **§1.1 Android feels like Material.** The feature set matches the
  other platforms; the expression is Material 3 — bottom bar/rail,
  `FilterChip`, `DropdownMenu`, `Switch`, `TabRow`. Never port iOS or
  tvOS chrome; never invent a custom control where an M3 one exists
  (`native-platform-first`).
- **§1.2 Compose-only, single Activity.** No Fragments, no AppCompat,
  no XML layouts beyond the splash/launcher theme. `minSdk [29]`,
  edge-to-edge.
- **§1.3 One shared data plane.** The phone consumes the same published
  data as every other client. No Android-only reads, hosts, or
  pipelines — and never re-derive policy flags client-side; the
  contract's one rule (`shared-data-plane-contract`).
- **§1.4 Manual DI, plain state navigation.** v1 is a single module with
  an `AppContainer` built in `Application` + a sealed `Route` back stack
  + `BackHandler`. Hilt/Navigation3 arrive only when module count or
  route complexity demands them — propose a rule change first.
- **§1.5 Depth ≤ 2 from any tab root.** Tab → grid/list → detail. A
  would-be third push must be a scope chip, dropdown, or sheet. Player
  and Settings are pushed routes; only an immersive surface is full-screen.

## §2 Data plane (contract compliance)

<!-- These rules assume the template's shared read-only SQLite data
     plane. If your Android app reads a different source, keep the
     invalidation + refresh discipline (§2.4/§2.3) and adapt the rest. -->

- **§2.1 One data read path.** A single repository layer implements the
  contract's query verbs with the standard filter clauses (visibility
  gates). Screens never touch SQLite, OkHttp, or asset files directly —
  they go through `AppContainer`'s repositories.
- **§2.2 BundledSQLiteDriver, read paths only.** The bundled driver
  **guarantees FTS5**; never fall back to framework SQLite for the
  dataset (framework SQLite may lack FTS5). Decode only the rows a
  screen shows — no in-memory copy of the whole dataset.
- **§2.3 The refresh ritual is fixed:** ETag-conditional GET of the
  compressed DB → stream-inflate raw DEFLATE (`Inflater(nowrap = true)`,
  64 KB chunks) to a STAGING file → size floor → open-probe row count →
  **atomic rename** → store ETag → bump `dbVersion`. Any failure keeps
  the cached DB; the bundled seed is the floor.
- **§2.4 Screens re-query on `dbVersion`.** Every screen that holds query
  results keys its `produceState`/`LaunchedEffect` on the data layer's
  `dbVersion` (and the user-state change signal where user records
  matter) so the
  seed→full-DB swap and filter changes propagate everywhere. **Forgetting
  this key is the classic "screen shows zero items" bug.**
- **§2.5 Editorial config is fetched, not re-hosted** (bundled copy as
  offline fallback). Composed sections resolve through a curated map —
  never by re-running a broad query (the duplicate-section bug).
- **§2.6 User state is local-first**: a tiny `user.sqlite` (same bundled
  driver); scalar settings in DataStore with the shared key names. A
  [sync island: Google Drive App Data] is a later wave (§7) and gates
  ONLY sync — browse always works signed-out (`per-ecosystem-sync-islands`).

## §3 Navigation shell

- **§3.1 [N] content tabs, hard set: [list]** via `NavigationSuiteScaffold`
  (bottom bar → rail → drawer by window size — one hierarchy, never
  forked per form factor). Settings is NOT a tab; it lives behind the
  gear. A new tab requires amending this rule.
- **§3.2 One route registry.** Every pushable destination is a case of
  the sealed `Route` handled in `AppRoot`. New destinations extend
  `Route` — never a per-screen ad-hoc overlay.
- **§3.3 System back pops the stack** (`BackHandler`); tab taps clear it.
- **§3.4 Deep links land in a pending-item inbox** — `[scheme]://item/{id}`
  (same scheme as the other platforms) is parsed in `MainActivity` and
  consumed once by `AppRoot`. New entry points (App Links, App Shortcuts)
  extend this inbox, never push routes from outside the composition. **App
  Links require the Play App Signing cert SHA-256 in `assetlinks.json`**
  (`store-submission-playbook`).

## §4 Surfaces

- **§4.1 Home order is fixed** and documented here (deduped downward,
  sections dropped under [N] items — the stub rule). Inserting a section
  means amending this rule. A visibility toggle (Settings) filters
  consumed items where applicable.
- **§4.2 Browse** = scope `FilterChip`s + facet dropdowns + adaptive
  `LazyVerticalGrid` with paging-on-scroll ([N]/page) and the REAL total
  from the count query. **Beware the contradictory-WHERE silent-empty
  bug: a clause that both EXCLUDES a type AND filters FOR it returns zero
  rows** — branch explicitly (`android-production-gotchas`).
- **§4.3 Search** = debounced (~[180] ms) full-text over the FTS5 index,
  grid results, explicit empty states.
- **§4.4 Detail** = header → title/meta → primary action → body →
  [rich-metadata rows, each shown only when present] → related. A
  parent/children variant (if content nests) uses a selector + a child
  list.
- **§4.5 Library / saved state** over `user.sqlite`. Empty states are
  explicit sentences, never blank space (`universal-feature-states`).
- **§4.6 Tiles are content + two text lines, nothing else** (density from
  removing chrome). Stable `key`s on every `LazyGrid`/`LazyRow`.

## §5 Player *(optional module — delete if no media)*

<!-- KEEP only if the app plays audio/video. -->

- **§5.1 Media3 `PlayerView` owns transport.** `keepScreenOn`, OkHttp
  `DataSource`, and a patient custom `LoadErrorHandlingPolicy` (more
  retries, modest capped backoff) so idle-connection resets resume from
  the byte offset instead of failing — the Android analog of a resilient
  loader (`resilient-media-streaming`). Overlays only; never a parallel
  transport.
- **§5.2 Never a runtime quality/bitrate ceiling** if the source URL is
  chosen at build time.
- **§5.3 Progress persists every [10] s and on dispose**; resume seeks
  within bounds. Ephemeral/live playback must NOT persist progress.

## §6 Theme

- **§6.1 [Brand theme]; dynamic color is NOT the default.** Material You
  dynamic color may become a Settings opt-in later; it never becomes the
  default (the brand identity is the product).
- **§6.2 Brand vs semantic split is absolute:** primary + accent are
  chrome/CTA only; any per-category accents carry content meaning only.
  Never a brand color for meaning, never a semantic accent for chrome.
- **§6.3 M3 typography styles only** — `headlineSmall`, `titleMedium`,
  `bodyMedium/Small`, `labelMedium/Small` with weight modifiers; six
  hierarchy levels, refuse a seventh (CLAUDE.md density rule).

## §7 Out of scope on Android v1 (intentional — next wave)

<!-- FILL: what ships later, not never — each with the reason, so it
     isn't partially implemented without a rule. Common items: Glance
     widgets + App Shortcuts, the Google Drive App Data sync island
     (needs the shared OAuth client; never a custom backend, never
     CloudKit), Google Cast, category-visibility toggles. -->

## §8 Parity discipline

- **§8.1** Update `PARITY.md` in the same change set as any user-facing
  feature; proposals/commits quote these rule numbers.
- **§8.2** A feature that lands differently from tvOS/iOS must be the
  *native Material idiom* of the same verb — name the rule it mirrors or
  deliberately inverts. Emulator-verify (release build) before claiming
  done (`android-production-gotchas`).

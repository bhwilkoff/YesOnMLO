# Archive Watch — TV Platform Implementation Backlog

**Status:** Active. Strategy = Decision 047. UI rules = `docs/TV-DESIGN.md`.
Platform viability/fees/submission = `docs/TV-PLATFORM-EXPANSION.md`.
**Created:** 2026-08-03.

Every item has an ID, an owner (**ENG** = implementable here, **OWNER** = only
Ben can do it), a size, dependencies, acceptance criteria, and the skill to
invoke. **Owner-blocked items are also collected in §OWNER at the bottom** —
that section is the answer to "what do I have to do to publish this?"

Sizes: **S** ≤ half a day · **M** 1–3 days · **L** 1–2 weeks · **XL** > 1 month.

## The shape of the work

Two builds unlock five of the seven native targets, and two zero-app routes cover
the closed platforms:

```
android/ (Kotlin + Compose + Media3, zero GMS)
    └── + TV form factor ──┬── Google TV / Android TV   (Play, $0 more)
                           └── Fire TV                  (Amazon, $0)

/ (vanilla PWA, no build step)
    └── + TV focus layer ──┬── LG webOS      (Seller Lounge, $0, global)
                           ├── Samsung Tizen (Seller Office, $0, US-only tier)
                           └── VIDAA / Titan / Zeasn  (partnership-gated)

Cast receiver (HTML) ──── Chromecast · Google TV · Chromecast-built-in (≈ Vizio)
AVPlayer (already ships) ─ AirPlay 2 TVs (Samsung · LG · Vizio · Sony · TCL · Roku TV)

Roku ──────────────────── full BrightScript/SceneGraph rewrite. Separate decision.
```

**Sequencing rationale.** Phase 1 (Cast + AirPlay) is days of work and is the
*only* realistic Vizio reach. Phase 2 (Android TV → Fire TV) is the biggest device
reach for ~100% engine reuse. Phase 3 (web-TV) reuses the PWA and needs no new
runtime. Roku is last because it is the only target with 0% code reuse.

---

## Phase 0 — Foundation (do first; unblocks everything)

| ID | Item | Who | Size | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **F1** | Land + correct `TV-PLATFORM-EXPANSION.md` on main | ENG | S | ✅ done |
| **F2** | `docs/TV-DESIGN.md` binding doc | ENG | M | ✅ done |
| **F3** | This backlog | ENG | S | ✅ done |
| **F4** | `DECISIONS.md` 047 — the TV expansion decision | ENG | S | ✅ done |
| **F5** | Add **Android TV** + **Web-TV** coverage to `PARITY.md` | ENG | S | ✅ done (§8b — a dedicated section, not 2 more columns on already-6-wide tables) |
| **F6** | Author project skills `androidtv-compose-focus` + `smarttv-web-app` | ENG | M | ✅ done |

**F5 note:** the existing tables are already six columns wide, so TV coverage
landed as a dedicated `PARITY.md` §8b (client table + verb table + a compliance-gate
line) rather than two more columns. Every non-✅ cell still carries a reason
(`cross-platform-parity-discipline`).

**F6 rationale:** no existing skill covers Compose for TV focus or Tizen/webOS
packaging. `android-production-gotchas` is phone-shaped; `web-platform-patterns`
is pointer-shaped. Per CLAUDE.md, patterns learned the hard way become skills
rather than being re-derived.

---

## Phase 1 — Zero-app reach: Cast + AirPlay

*Highest ROI in the whole backlog. No store, no review, no certification.*

| ID | Item | Who | Size | Deps |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **C1** ✅ | Register in the Google Cast SDK Developer Console; pay the one-time **$5**; create an app ID | **OWNER** | S | Done 2026-08-05. Custom Receiver **`58AF34C3`** → `https://archivewatch.org/cast/`. Android TV package left BLANK on purpose (filling it makes Cast launch our native TV app, which implements a sender not a receiver). Published — see C6 |
| **C6** ✅ | **Publish the receiver** in the Cast console | **OWNER** | S | **Published 2026-08-05.** Publishing was BLOCKED until at least one sender was declared — added Chrome (`https://archivewatch.org/`) and Android (`com.archivewatch.app`). Listing left **Unlisted** (no public Chromecast-apps listing; the app is reached from our own senders). Propagation can take up to ~24h |
| **C2** ✅ | Build the **Custom Web Receiver** (CAF v3) page, hosted at `archivewatch.org/cast/` | ENG | M | C1 |
| **C3** ✅ | Cast **sender** in the web viewer (Cast SDK for Web) | ENG | M | C2 |
| **C4** ✅ | Cast **sender** in the Android phone app — **excluded from the Fire variant** | ENG | M | C2, A7 · `CastOptionsProvider` + system `MediaRouteButton` + `loadMedia` on the google flavor only; hand-off POLLED (a `SessionManagerListener` type exists only in that flavor and referencing it would undo the structural split). Not offered on TV — a television is a receiver, not a sender. Binary-verified both ways |
| ~~C5~~ | Register a physical Cast device for testing | **OWNER** | S | **No longer required** — device registration only exists to launch an UNPUBLISHED receiver. Now that C6 is published, any Cast device can launch it |
| **A0** ✅ | Confirm + expose the **AirPlay** route in the iOS player | ENG | S | — · **the "no new code" premise was WRONG** — see below |

**C2 notes.** The receiver is HTML/JS and reuses the PWA player, including the
`captions[]` → `<track>` conversion and the resilient reconnect. It is hosted
static — it fits the existing GitHub Pages model exactly. Receiver v2 is
deprecated; build **CAF v3**.

**C4 warning.** Cast is **GMS-dependent**. It must be compiled out of the Fire TV
variant or the Fire build breaks (`TV-DESIGN §6.6`). This is the single
cross-cutting constraint between Phase 1 and Phase 2.

**A0 notes — CORRECTED 2026-08-05.** The original premise ("`AVPlayer` already
exposes AirPlay, so this is verify-and-document, not build") was **wrong for
this player**, and the correction is the whole point of the item.

Every playback path here is backed by a **custom-scheme resource loader** —
`aw-stream://` for progressive MP4 (Decisions 021 / 031 / 034) and Config C for
captioned HLS. Apple is explicit that **video AirPlay is unsupported with a
custom `AVAssetResourceLoaderDelegate`**: the delegate that serves those bytes
lives on the *sending* device, so an AirPlay receiver has nothing it can fetch.
AirPlay would therefore have failed on **every title**, and nothing in the build
or a screenshot would have shown it.

Fixed in `PlayerView_iOS.swift`: the player observes
`AVPlayer.isExternalPlaybackActive` and, when a route engages, swaps to a URL
the **receiver** can pull itself — preferring the published HLS (which also
keeps the WebVTT caption renditions) and falling back to the plain MP4. When the
route disengages it rebuilds the resilient on-device item, mirroring the branch
in `makeUIViewController`, preserving position and metadata. The stall/fallback
machinery is detached while external, since it watches the local loader paths.

Losing loader resilience on AirPlay costs nothing: the **receiver owns the
connection**, so byte-range resume and node failover are unavailable on that
path regardless — the same trade Decision 047 records for Roku.

Code landed in commit `e2286886` (bundled with the Cast work; that message does
not mention it).

**⏳ Owner QA — the one thing that cannot be verified here:** AirPlay routes do
not exist in the Simulator. On a real iPhone + Apple TV: start a film, pick the
AirPlay route, confirm video appears on the TV (not a black screen), then
disengage and confirm playback resumes on-device at the same position.

Reach is Apple TV plus AirPlay-2 TVs from Samsung, LG, Vizio, Sony, TCL, Hisense,
Roku TV and Philips — but only in Apple households, so it is reach, not discovery.

**Phase 1 acceptance:** a film plays on a Chromecast-built-in TV from both the
web viewer and the Android phone app, with captions selectable and resume
written back; AirPlay route confirmed on a real iPhone.

---

## Phase 2 — Android TV → Google TV, then Fire TV

*~100% engine reuse. The work is a 10-foot UI, not a port.*

### 2a — Platform compliance

| ID | Item | Who | Size | Acceptance |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A1** ✅ | `LEANBACK_LAUNCHER` intent filter (TV-ML) | ENG | S | App appears in the Android TV launcher |
| **A2** ✅ | `touchscreen` + TV-absent hardware `required="false"` (TV-MT) | ENG | S | Play accepts the AAB for the TV form factor |
| **A3** ✅ | **320×180 banner containing the app name** + ≥160×160 xhdpi icon (TV-LB/TV-BN) | ENG | S | Banner renders in the launcher; name legible |
| **A4** ✅ | Landscape, no letterboxing, 5% overscan insets (TV-LO/TV-OV) | ENG | S | Nothing clipped on a real panel |
| **A5** ✅ | **TV-G6 audit: 64-bit + 16 KB page size** across `sqlite-bundled`, Media3, Coil | ENG | M | Every bundled `.so` is 16 KB-aligned; **live requirement since 2026-08-01** |
| **A6** ✅ | Confirm TV-PS (`minSdk` ≤ 31 — currently 29) and TV-G1 (AAB) | ENG | S | Both already satisfied; assert in CI |

**A5 is the sleeper risk.** It went live two days before this backlog was
written, it is not automatically satisfied, and it blocks the TV form factor.
Do it early — the fix may be a dependency bump, which has lead time.

### 2b — The 10-foot UI (the real work)

| ID | Item | Who | Size | Deps |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A7** ✅ | Add `androidx.tv:tv-material` **1.1.0**; runtime TV branch via `UiModeManager` (TV-DESIGN §6.5) | ENG | S | — |
| **A8** ✅ | Focus primitives: focusable card with scale+ring+lift, initial-focus claim, row/grid containers on standard `LazyRow`/`LazyColumn` | ENG | M | A7 |
| **A9** ✅ | TV **Home** — hero + editorial rows + category/decade rows | ENG | M | A8 |
| **A10** ✅ | TV **Browse/Movies** + **TV Shows** grids with facets | ENG | M | A8 |
| **A11** ✅ | TV **Detail** — hero, metadata, Play/Favorite, More Like This | ENG | M | A8 |
| **A12** ✅ | TV **Search** — D-pad-operable, with the no-typing browse escape (TV-DESIGN §3.6) | ENG | M | A8 |
| **A13** ✅ | TV **Library** + **Settings** | ENG | S | A8 |
| **A14** ✅ | TV **Player**: Media3 `PlayerView` TV controls, D-pad center/left/right (TV-PC), `KEYCODE_MEDIA_PLAY_PAUSE` (TV-PP), title+description overlay (Decision 037) | ENG | M | A8 |
| **A15** ✅ | **⚠️ Gate `media3-session` MediaSession OFF on TV; pause video on switch-away (TV-NP)** | ENG | S | A14 |
| **A16** ✅ | Back returns to launcher from root, never mid-playback (TV-DB) | ENG | S | A8 |
| **A17** ✅ | Subtitles via Media3 `SubtitleConfiguration` from `captions[]` | ENG | S | ✅ inherited from the shared player; **verified rendering on the TV emulator** |
| **A18** ✅ | v1.1 surfaces: Channels · Surprise · Collections (TV-DESIGN §2) | ENG | L | A9 |

**A15 is a shipped-code conflict, not a new feature.** The MediaSession added for
phone lock-screen controls in the 2026-06-13 parity wave violates TV-NP for a
video app. It must be gated by device type.

**Skill:** invoke `androidtv-compose-focus` (F6) plus `android-production-gotchas`
for the data-layer/`produceState` discipline, which is unchanged on TV.

### 2c — Ship

| ID | Item | Who | Size |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A19** ✅ | Emulator verification (Android TV emulator image) on every surface | ENG | M | **Unblocked.** The original diagnosis (disk) was WRONG — the emulator's own log said `Available Memory: 951 MB, Required: 5120 MB` while the disk check PASSED. It was **RAM** on an 8 GB Mac. Boots headless with `-no-window -gpu swiftshader_indirect -memory 2048`. `tools/verify_tv_focus.sh` asserts 9 surfaces by remote |
| **A20** | **Buy an Android TV / Google TV device** for real-remote QA | **OWNER** | S |
| **A21** | Play Console → *Setup › Advanced settings › Form factors › Add Android TV*; accept the TV policy | **OWNER** | S |
| **A22** | TV screenshots (≥1, up to 8) + TV banner upload + "Android TV" in the description | **OWNER** (assets by ENG) | S | **Assets are DONE and waiting at `~/Desktop/ArchiveWatch-TV-Screenshots/`** — six 1920×1080 shots + the 320×180 banner. Regenerate any time with `./tools/tv_screenshots.sh`. Upload is owner-only: the Play Console page would not accept automation (see §OWNER) |
| **A23** | Submit; pass the **separate Android TV app-quality review** | **OWNER** | S |

### 2d — Fire TV

| ID | Item | Who | Size | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A24** ✅ | Fire variant: **exclude Cast/any GMS**; re-assert zero-GMS in CI | ENG | S | Dependency set is already GMS-free — keep it that way |
| **A25** | Validate Media3 1.9.4 progressive-MP4 playback on **real Fire hardware** | ENG+OWNER | M | Do **not** adopt the stale `amzn` ExoPlayer port |
| **A26** | **Buy a Fire TV Stick (~$30)** | **OWNER** | S | Amazon expects physical-device QA |
| **A27** | **Create a free Amazon Developer account** | **OWNER** | S | $0 registration, $0 submission |
| **A28** | Submit to the Amazon Appstore (APK/AAB + assets + Fire TV form factors) | **OWNER** | S | **Artifact READY**: `~/Desktop/ArchiveWatch-TV-Screenshots/ArchiveWatch-FireTV-<version>.apk` — signed release, verified zero-GMS and TV-G6 16 KB-aligned. Reuse the same six 1920×1080 screenshots. Review ≈ 3–5 business days |

**Phase 2 acceptance:** the same AAB installs and is fully D-pad-operable on an
Android TV device and a Fire TV Stick; both pass the §9 remote/ten-foot/parity
tests; phone build is byte-for-byte unaffected in behavior.

---

## Phase 3 — Web-TV → LG webOS, then Samsung Tizen

*Reuses the PWA. The work is an input layer, not a rewrite.*

### 3a — Shared TV layer

| ID | Item | Who | Size | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **W1** ✅ | Vanilla **spatial-navigation focus engine** (~200 lines): registry, nearest-in-direction resolver, roving `tabindex`, `scrollIntoView`, single `keydown` | ENG | M | Norigin et al. are React-only → out (TV-DESIGN §7.1) |
| **W2** ✅ | Register/unregister focusables on `showView()` — same lifecycle discipline as the IntersectionObservers | ENG | S | |
| **W3** ✅ | TV CSS breakpoint: 1920×1080, 5% overscan insets, 24px body floor, dark-first | ENG | M | Additive to the mobile-first CSS |
| **W4** ✅ | Player key contract: center=play/pause, L/R=seek, media keys; overlay syncs with controls | ENG | M | |
| **W5** ✅ | Subtitles: SRT→WebVTT client-side → `<track>` | ENG | S | A cross-origin `<track>` fails **silently** (readyState 3, zero cues) and `crossorigin` on `<video>` is unavailable — archive.org's storage nodes send no CORS, so it would break playback. Fetched into a same-origin `blob:` instead; verified 1,947 cues |
| **W6** ✅ | Lifecycle: pause on suspend/blur; resume state | ENG | S | |
| **W7** ✅ | Bump the service-worker shell version | ENG | S | Or TVs serve a stale app for days |

### 3b — LG webOS *(first: individuals can publish globally)*

| ID | Item | Who | Size | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **L1** ✅ | `appinfo.json`; `ares-package` → `.ipk` | ENG | S | **A real `.ipk` is built** — `tv/dist/org.archivewatch.app_<version>_all.ipk`. CLI resolved: `npm i -g @webos-tools/cli` → **3.2.5**. Needs `-n/--no-minify` (undocumented): the bundled uglify-js cannot parse modern syntax and aborts the package. Version is stamped from `AppVersion.xcconfig` at build time |
| **L2** ✅ | webOS shim: Back = keyCode **461**; `webOSLaunch`/`webOSRelaunch` | ENG | S | |
| **L3** ✅ | **Magic Remote pointer coexistence** with D-pad focus | ENG | M | Not optional (TV-DESIGN §7.4) · verified in-browser + 5 permanent assertions in `tools/tv_browser_tests.js`: hover moves focus, **D-pad continues from the hovered element**, inert chrome and hidden views never steal focus, no scroll jump |
| **L4** | **Create a free LG Seller Lounge account** (individual, 18+, global OK) | **OWNER** | S | |
| **L5** | **Create an LG Developer account + enable Developer Mode on an LG TV**; side-load the `.ipk` | **OWNER** | S | Requires access to an LG TV |
| **L6** | Store assets: **1280×720** screenshots, description, content rating | ENG assets / **OWNER** upload | S | ⚠️ Capture these from a REAL LG panel during the L5 side-load, not from a desktop browser. Attempted here and rejected: the web-TV CSS targets 1920×1080, so a desktop-width capture clips the nav, and forcing a 1920 layout via a CSS transform breaks the lazy-load geometry (70 of 363 posters loaded) — the result misrepresents the app. Since L5 already requires the TV, capture there |
| **L7** ✅ | **UX scenario doc + the mandatory self-checklist** | ENG drafts / **OWNER** submits | M | ✅ drafted at `docs/webos-submission.md` — paste-ready |
| **L8** | Submit; pretest + function test + content test | **OWNER** | S | ≈ 5–10 business days, often 2–3 cycles |

### 3c — Samsung Tizen

| ID | Item | Who | Size | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **S1** ✅ | `config.xml`; `tizen build-web` + `tizen package` → signed `.wgt` | ENG | S | **Keep the signing certificate — updates must reuse it** |
| **S2** ✅ | Tizen shim: `tizen.tvinputdevice.registerKey()` for media keys; `tizenhwkey` Back; `visibilitychange` pause | ENG | S | |
| **S3** | **Create a free TV Seller Office account** | **OWNER** | S | |
| **S4** | **Decide: US-only Public Seller, or sign an offline contract with Samsung HQ for Partner (global)** | **OWNER** | — | Business decision, not engineering · framed with options at `docs/tizen-submission.md` §1 |
| **S5** | Enable Developer Mode on a Samsung TV (keyed to the TV's IP); side-load | **OWNER** | S | Requires access to a Samsung TV |
| **S6** | Submit; Samsung manual QA against the Launch/Development checklists | **OWNER** | S | ≈ 1–2 weeks, multi-cycle rejections common |

### 3d — Aggregators (opportunistic)

| ID | Item | Who | Size | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **G1** | Inquire with **Titan OS** partner portal (all Philips TVs from 2026; strong in Europe) | **OWNER** | S | Closest thing to self-serve HTML5 onboarding; cost not published |
| **G2** | Inquire with **VIDAA/Hisense** (~40M devices) and **Zeasn/Foxxum** | **OWNER** | S | Same HTML5 build; no public indie door found (2026-08) |

**Phase 3 acceptance:** one shared web build runs fully D-pad-operable on an LG
TV and a Samsung TV, differing only in the shim files; the phone/desktop web
viewer is unaffected.

---

## Phase 4 — Roku (separate funded decision; NOT started)

**0% code reuse.** BrightScript + SceneGraph is a proprietary stack with no
Swift/Kotlin/JS runtime and no general WebView app model. Industry consensus is
**~2–4 months for one experienced Roku developer**, more when learning
BrightScript cold. Roku's no-code Direct Publisher was sunset in January 2024,
and its feed ceiling never fit a 40k-item catalog anyway.

**The case for it:** Roku is **#1 in US CTV** (~37–38% of devices, ~44% of CTV
viewing hours, 100M+ global active households) and skews toward exactly the
value-seeking free-content viewer Archive Watch is for. It is the highest-reach
platform we are not on. Fees are **$0**.

**Known blockers to price in before committing:**

- **R-a — Deep linking is mandatory** for public video apps, and feeds Roku
  Search. Real, non-trivial new work.
- **R-b — Performance thresholds:** home fully rendered **within 15s**, content
  playing **within 8s**. ⚠️ The archive.org `/download` 302-redirect latency
  (~0.5–1.0s TTFB measured on Apple) is the most likely certification friction
  point. **Measure this on real Roku hardware before committing budget.**
- **R-c — Playback resilience regression.** Roku's `Video` node **owns
  networking**; there is no `AVAssetResourceLoaderDelegate` equivalent, so
  Decisions 021/031/034 (byte-range resume, node failover) **cannot be
  reproduced**. Mitigate by preferring HLS/DASH derivatives where available.
  This is a genuine quality regression and must be an accepted trade-off, in
  writing, before starting.
- **R-d — Certification drifts.** Roku ships periodic certification updates
  (a Spring 2026 update exists). Read the live checklist at submission time.

**Not blockers:** Roku Pay does not apply (free, no login), and the new
2026-10-01 Continue Watching / Instant Resume mandates apply only above
5M hours/month (US) — far above us.

**Recommendation:** do not start Roku until Phases 1–3 ship and R-b has been
measured on hardware. Then log it as its own decision with a budget.

---

## Not pursued (with reasons)

| Platform | Why not |
|---|---|
| **Vizio SmartCast** | No public self-serve program or open SDK; onboarding is BD-gated through Vizio-designated partners and requires credentials Vizio issues. Post-Walmart it is an ad-monetization vehicle — a free, no-ads PD app is strategically uninteresting to them. **Reach it via Cast + AirPlay instead.** |
| **Comcast/Sky (RDK/Firebolt)** | Public SDK, but distribution is partner/certification-gated. Build-possible, ship-unlikely for a solo free app. |
| **TiVo OS (Xperi)** | HTML5, but no public self-serve indie program surfaced. |

---

## §OWNER — everything only Ben can do

**Status 2026-08-07.** Engineering is complete for every platform that has a
self-serve door. Nothing below is waiting on code; each item needs an account,
a physical device, money, or a business decision.

### Step 1 — Amazon Fire TV (do this first: free, no hardware needed to submit)

| # | Action | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| O3 | Create a free **Amazon Developer account** | $0 |
| O16 | Upload `app-amazon-release.apk` (staged, 1.3.314/vc29), target the **Fire TV** form factors, attach the 1920×1080 screenshots + description, submit | $0 |

Review is ~3–5 business days. This is the highest-value next move: the build is
signed, zero-GMS-verified and TV-G6-verified, and Amazon does not gate
submission on owning the device.

### Step 2 — Verify Google Play has nothing outstanding (5 minutes)

Play Console → *Grow → Store presence → Main store listing*, and the **Android
TV** form-factor panel. Everything it used to ask for is now uploaded via the
API (6 TV screenshots, the 1280×720 TV banner, an "ON YOUR TV" description
section), and production is live at 1.3.314 / vc29. Confirm the TV panel shows
no remaining requirement and that the TV app-quality review is queued.

**Also re-check the TV submission you made on 2026-08-05.** Play's API shows the
previous live production release was versionCode **10** (1.3.251) and that
nothing above vc13 ever existed — so that submission is not reflected in the
track history. Worth confirming it actually landed.

### Step 3 — LG webOS (individuals can publish globally — do before Samsung)

| # | Action | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| O4 | Create a free **LG Seller Lounge** account (individual, 18+) **and** a separate LG Developer account for Developer Mode | $0 |
| O8 | Get access to an **LG TV**; install the Developer Mode app from the LG Content Store | — |
| O17 | Side-load `tv/dist/org.archivewatch.app_1.3.314_all.ipk` (`ares-setup-device`, `ares-install`), spot-check per `docs/webos-submission.md` §5, capture the **1280×720 screenshots on the panel**, then submit with the UX scenario + self-checklist already drafted there | $0 |

The screenshots must come from the TV (or a ≥1920-wide display): the layout
targets a 1920 CSS-px viewport, and below that the top nav and category rail
clip. Do not force 1920 with a CSS transform — it breaks lazy-load.

### Step 4 — Samsung Tizen (needs a decision first)

| # | Action | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| O12 | **Decide:** accept **US-only** distribution on the default Public Seller tier, or pursue Partner Seller (an offline contract with Samsung HQ — i.e. a business entity) | — |
| O5 | Create a free **Samsung TV Seller Office** account | $0 |
| O5b | Install **Tizen Studio CLI** and create a signing certificate — **KEEP THAT CERTIFICATE**, every future update must be signed with the same one | $0 |
| O9 | Access to a **Samsung TV** (Developer Mode is keyed to the TV's IP) | — |
| O18 | `bash tv/build-tv-packages.sh tizen` produces the payload; sign it into a `.wgt`, then submit to Seller Office (manual QA, ~1–2 weeks) | $0 |

### Step 5 — Device QA (the things no emulator can prove)

| # | Check |
|---|---|
| O6 | An **Android TV / Google TV** device (~$30–100) — real remote, real HDMI |
| O7 | A **Fire TV Stick** (~$30) — confirm the zero-GMS build runs on Fire OS |
| O10 | A **Cast** device — the receiver is published, so any Chromecast works |
| O20 | **AirPlay on a real iPhone + Apple TV.** The Simulator exposes no AirPlay routes, so this path has never been exercised on hardware — and it was silently broken until 2026-08-05 |

### Standing decisions

| # | Decision |
|---|---|
| O13 | **Fund Roku?** ~2–4 months, 0% code reuse, for the largest US CTV audience — and its `Video` node owns networking, so the Decision 021/031/034 playback resilience cannot be reproduced. A real quality regression to accept knowingly. |
| O14 | **Aggregator inquiries** (Titan OS, VIDAA, Zeasn/Foxxum) — unpublished pricing, partnership conversations. Before starting one, note the 1920-viewport assumption above: webOS/Tizen present 1920, these are unverified. |

### Exact steps for what is sitting ready right now

Everything below is built, verified, and staged at **1.3.314 / versionCode 29**
(2026-08-07). Regenerate any of it with the commands shown.

| Artifact | Path | Rebuild with |
|---|---|---|
| Fire TV APK (signed, zero-GMS, TV-G6) | `android/app/build/outputs/apk/amazon/release/app-amazon-release.apk` | `cd android && ./gradlew assembleAmazonRelease` |
| LG webOS package | `tv/dist/org.archivewatch.app_1.3.314_all.ipk` | `bash tv/build-tv-packages.sh webos` |
| Samsung Tizen payload (unsigned — needs your cert) | `tv/tizen/app/` | `bash tv/build-tv-packages.sh tizen` |
| 1920×1080 store screenshots ×6 | `~/Desktop/ArchiveWatch-TV-Screenshots/` | `bash tools/tv_screenshots.sh` (emulator booted) |
| Store TV banner **1280×720** | `assets/tv/tv-banner-1280x720.png` | `python3 tools/make_tv_banner.py` |
| In-APK leanback banner **320×180** | `android/app/src/main/res/drawable-xhdpi/tv_banner.png` | same command (renders both) |

**⚠️ The two "TV banners" are different assets and this doc previously conflated
them.** Play's STORE `tvBanner` field is **1280×720** — uploading the 320×180
returns `Invalid dimensions - expected width: [1280], expected height: [720]`.
The 320×180 is the in-APK `android:banner` the launcher draws (TV-BN).
`tools/make_tv_banner.py` renders both from the photographic master so they can
never drift apart again.

**LG 1280×720 screenshots — still yours, and here is the precise reason.** The
web-TV layout targets a **1920 CSS-px viewport** (webOS and Tizen both present
1920 regardless of panel resolution). Captured below that, the top nav overflows
on the right and the category rail clips — verified 2026-08-07 at a 1456 px
viewport. So a faithful LG capture needs either a ≥1920-wide display or the TV
itself during side-load. Do NOT force 1920 with a CSS transform: it breaks
lazy-load geometry (70 of 363 posters failed to resolve when that was tried).

*Related risk worth knowing before the aggregators (O14):* because the layout
assumes 1920, any platform that reports a narrower CSS viewport would clip the
same way. webOS/Tizen are safe; VIDAA / Titan OS / Zeasn are unverified.

### Standing rights obligation (applies to every platform)

**O19 — The rights-audit exclusions (Decisions 027 / 044) must stay enforced.** A
reviewer spot-checking a famous copyrighted title on the home screen is a
rejection *and takedown* risk on every one of these stores, exactly as on Apple.
The nightly `publish-db` enforcement is what keeps this true — do not let it
drift into report-only mode again.

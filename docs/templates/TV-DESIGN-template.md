# Archive Watch — Non-Apple TV Design (BINDING)

**Binding.** Every view, row, overlay, key handler, or focus behavior in the
**Android TV / Google TV / Fire TV** build and the **web-TV (webOS · Tizen ·
VIDAA · aggregator)** build must trace to a rule here. When something feels
wrong, **fix this document first, then fix the feature.** Commits cite the rule,
e.g. "per TV-DESIGN §3.2."

Division of labor:
- **This doc** = the binding contract for the two *non-Apple* 10-foot builds.
- **`docs/tvOS-DESIGN.md`** = the binding contract for Apple TV. **This doc
  inherits its information architecture wholesale** (§2 below) — Archive Watch is
  one product, and the IA is not re-litigated per platform.
- **`docs/tvos-playbook.md`** = Apple-specific mechanics. Its *principles*
  (ten-foot type, focus does the work, dark-first) transfer; its *APIs* do not.
- **`docs/TV-PLATFORM-EXPANSION.md`** = platform viability, fees, submission.
- **`docs/TV-PLATFORM-BACKLOG.md`** = the ordered work list.
- **`DECISIONS.md` 047** = why this expansion exists and why two builds, not six.

## §1 — Principles (the why)

**1.1 One product, five remotes.** A TV build is not a port of the phone app and
not a reskin of the Apple TV app. It is the same product expressed in the native
idiom of its platform — Material focus on Android TV, DOM focus on web-TV. The
*verb* is identical (PARITY.md rule); the *idiom* is local.

**1.2 Focus does the work.** Inherited from tvOS-DESIGN §1.2. The focused element
is the chrome; everything around it stays quiet. Density comes from removing
chrome, not adding decoration. On a 10-foot screen this is not taste — an
unfocusable or ambiguously-focused element is *unusable*, and it fails Google's
TV-DP and LG's/Samsung's function tests outright.

**1.3 D-pad reachability is agency, not a checkbox.** CLAUDE.md's "Why we build"
asks whether a design invites the user to engage more fully. On a TV, the remote
*is* the entire vocabulary of engagement. Any function reachable only by pointer,
gesture, or text entry is a function that platform's users do not have. This is
the learning-orientation gate expressed as an engineering rule.

**1.4 No opaque "for you" feed.** Every TV platform offers a home-screen
recommendation surface (Google TV channels, Roku Continue Watching, Fire TV
integration). We may publish to them, but **what we publish is our own editorial
shelves and the user's own Continue Watching** — never a model's opinion the user
cannot inspect. Archive Watch exposes the structure of the catalog (categories,
decades, collections, community signals) so a viewer learns how the archive is
organized. A black-box row teaches nothing. *(Learning-orientation guardrail 1.)*

**1.5 No lean-back-only degraded build.** It is tempting to ship TV as "hero +
autoplay + nothing else." Browse, Search, Favorites, Playlists, Channels and
Surprise are what make the catalog explorable rather than consumable. A TV build
that drops the participatory surfaces is a *smaller product*, not a simpler one.
Deferrals are allowed and must be recorded as deliberate-defer cells in
PARITY.md with a reason. *(Learning-orientation guardrail 2.)*

**1.6 Lean-back, then lean-in.** Inherited from tvOS-DESIGN §1.1. Every surface
must work as pure browse but should offer one door to curiosity — a synopsis, a
cast connection, a "part of this collection" link. *(Learning-orientation
guardrail 3.)*

**1.7 Back is sacred.** Back never gets swallowed. On Android TV, Back from the
root returns to the launcher (TV-DB). On webOS, Back is keyCode **461**; on
Tizen it is the `tizenhwkey` event — both must navigate back, and exit from the
root. Intercepting Back is a certification failure on all three.

**1.8 Highest quality, faithfully presented.** Inherited from tvOS-DESIGN §1.6.
Progressive H.264 MP4 over HTTPS plays natively on every one of these platforms —
no DRM, no transcode, no bitrate ceiling (Decision 021).

---

## §2 — Information architecture (inherited, not re-derived)

The top-level surfaces are **exactly** those of `docs/tvOS-DESIGN.md §2`: Home,
Movies, TV, Channels, Collections, Search, Surprise, Library, Settings. Adding,
removing, or renaming a top-level surface on a TV build is a change to
tvOS-DESIGN, not a local decision.

**Depth ≤ 2 from any root** (tvOS-DESIGN §1.4) binds here too and binds *harder*:
a third push on a D-pad is a maze. Tab → row/grid → detail. A would-be third
level becomes a scope, an overlay, or a different root.

**Per-platform launch scope.** A platform may ship a subset, in this order, and
must record the rest as deliberate-defer in PARITY.md:

| Wave | Surfaces | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **v1 (required to ship)** | Home · Movies · TV · Search · Detail · Player · Library · Settings | The spine. Below this it is not Archive Watch. |
| **v1.1** | Channels · Surprise · Collections | The participatory surfaces (§1.5). Defer only for a launch date, never permanently. |
| **v2** | Cartoon Mode · Playlists · platform home-screen integration | Depth. |

**Never on a TV build:** Clip Studio and Creation Studio (Decisions 033 / 042 —
creation requires text entry and direct manipulation; a remote has neither).

---

## §3 — The focus contract (binding)

This is the section that separates a TV app from a resized app. It binds both
builds; §6 and §7 give the per-platform mechanics.

**3.1 Something is always focused.** There is no state in which the user presses
a direction key and nothing is highlighted. On view entry, focus is claimed
imperatively — never left to a default. (This is the same lesson as the Apple
build's initial-focus rule; it is universal to focus engines.)

**3.2 Focus is visible from ten feet.** The focused item is distinguished by
**at least two** of: scale (1.06–1.10×), a border/ring, and an elevation/shadow
lift. Color alone is never sufficient — it fails for color-blind viewers and
washes out on a bright living-room panel. The unfocused state carries no
competing decoration.

**3.3 Focus never leaves the screen.** Focusing an item scrolls it into view with
its row header and neighbors visible. A focused element under an overscan margin
or behind a sticky header is a bug.

**3.4 No focus traps and no dead ends.** From every focusable element there is a
path back to the root by pressing Back and a path to a neighbor in at least one
direction. Rows wrap or stop deliberately; they never strand.

**3.5 Directional intent is preserved.** Up/Down moves between rows, Left/Right
within a row. A grid moves in both axes. Never remap an axis for cleverness — the
mental model is a physical grid.

**3.6 Text entry is the last resort.** On-screen keyboards are slow. Search must
be reachable and usable, but every *browse* path must be complete without typing:
category rows, decade rows, collections, and Surprise exist so that a viewer can
find something without ever opening a keyboard.

## §4 — Layout, type, and color (binding)

**4.1 Canvas.** 1920×1080 is the design baseline for both builds. Android TV
scales by density; web-TV uses a fixed 1920×1080 viewport with CSS scaling.

**4.2 Overscan-safe margins.** **5% inset on every edge** (96px horizontal, 54px
vertical at 1080p). Nothing meaningful — text, focus rings at rest, controls —
crosses that line. Full-bleed artwork may, and must be designed to be cropped.

**4.3 Type scale.** Six levels, per `mobile-first-density-design`: three weights ×
two sizes. Minimum **body size 24px at 1080p** (the ten-foot floor); row headers
32px; hero title 48–64px. A seventh level is refused — refactor instead.

**4.4 Dark-first.** The canvas is near-black. Living rooms are dark and a bright
UI is fatiguing at 10 feet. Light mode is not offered on TV.

**4.5 Color follows the shared system.** Brand chrome (`--color-primary`
`#FF5C35`, `--color-accent` `#0047FF`) and the per-category semantic accents are
**exactly** those in CLAUDE.md and Decision 013. The split is binding: never a
brand color for content meaning, never a semantic color for chrome.

**4.6 Rows over grids at the root.** Home is horizontal rows (the 10-foot idiom).
Grids are for a *chosen* scope — a category, a decade, search results — where the
user has already narrowed and wants density.

---

## §5 — Player surfaces (binding)

**5.1 The native transport is the transport.** Per `native-platform-first` and
Decision 037's hard-won lesson: never build a custom scrubber over a platform
player. Android TV uses the Media3 `PlayerView` TV controls; web-TV uses the
platform `<video>` element's controls plus our key handler.

**5.2 Key contract (both builds).** D-pad **center** toggles play/pause; **left/
right** seek (rewind/fast-forward); dedicated media keys (`KEYCODE_MEDIA_PLAY_PAUSE`
on Android; the registered Tizen/webOS media keys) toggle during playback. Back
exits the player to the previous surface, never to the launcher mid-playback.

**5.3 Title + description overlay** appears and disappears **with** the transport
controls, per Decision 037. It is non-interactive and never blocks the controls.

**5.4 ⚠️ Video pauses on switch-away; no background media controls.** Android's
TV-NP is explicit: a *video* app must not surface Now Playing / system media
controls and must pause when the user switches out. The phone build's
`media3-session` `MediaSession` (shipped 2026-06-13) **must be gated off on TV.**
This is a rule, not a preference — it is a quality-review failure otherwise.

**5.5 Subtitles side-load, never burn in.** The `captions[]` contract (Decisions
039 / 043) is directly usable: Media3 `SubtitleConfiguration` on Android TV, a
`<track kind="subtitles">` on web-TV. If captions exist they must be
user-selectable — a rule on every platform.

The pipeline already emits WebVTT (`vttURL`) for 404 of 411 SRT sources, so
client-side conversion is a fallback, not the main path.

**⚠️ On web-TV the track MUST be fetched into a same-origin blob.** A
cross-origin `<track>` fails silently, and the usual fix — `crossorigin` on the
media element — is UNAVAILABLE here: archive.org 302s video to a storage node
that sends no CORS header (Decision 029, re-verified), so `crossorigin` on
`<video>` would break PLAYBACK. This bites the PACKAGED apps hardest: a webOS
`.ipk` / Tizen `.wgt` serves the page from a local app origin, so a remote VTT
is always cross-origin. On archivewatch.org the VTT is same-origin, which is
exactly why the bug hid.

**5.6 Playback resilience is per-platform, and it is not optional.** Archive.org
resets idle connections (Decisions 021 / 031 / 034). Android TV inherits the
phone build's Media3 `LoadErrorHandlingPolicy`; web-TV inherits the web viewer's
nudge-reconnect. A platform whose player owns networking and cannot be made
resilient (Roku) must have that regression recorded before work starts.

## §6 — Android TV mechanics (binding where marked)

**6.1 Dependency (binding).** `androidx.tv:tv-material` **only**. `tv-foundation`
and every `TvLazy*` composable were removed once their behavior merged into
`compose-foundation` — use standard `LazyRow` / `LazyColumn` /
`LazyVerticalGrid`. Any code or tutorial using `TvLazy*` is stale.

**6.2 One app, two form factors (binding).** The TV build is the **same
`applicationId` and the same AAB** as the phone build, with
`android.software.leanback` and `android.hardware.touchscreen` both declared
`required="false"`. TV is a form factor of one Play listing, not a second app.
Never fork the app.

**6.3 Manifest contract (binding).** `LEANBACK_LAUNCHER` intent filter (TV-ML);
touchscreen and all TV-absent hardware `required="false"` (TV-MT); 320×180 banner
containing the app name, localized per supported language (TV-LB / TV-BN);
≥160×160 xhdpi icon; landscape without letterboxing (TV-LO).

**6.4 Platform floors (binding).** `minSdk` ≤ 31 (TV-PS — ours is 29). **64-bit +
16 KB page-size compliance across every bundled native library (TV-G6, live since
2026-08-01)** — `sqlite-bundled`, Media3 and Coil must each be verified, not
assumed. AAB is mandatory (TV-G1).

**6.5 Device branching, not device forking.** TV layouts are selected at runtime
by `UiModeManager` type (`UI_MODE_TYPE_TELEVISION`), not by a build flavor. The
data layer, repositories, player engine, and navigation routes are **shared
verbatim** with the phone build — only the composables differ.

**6.6 Fire TV divergence.** Fire OS is the same build with **no GMS**. Our
dependency set is already GMS-free. The standing rule: **anything GMS-dependent —
Cast first and foremost — is excluded from the Fire variant.** Media3 (not the
stale `amzn` ExoPlayer port) is the player, validated on real Fire hardware.

---

## §7 — Web-TV mechanics (binding where marked)

**7.1 Vanilla, no build step (binding).** Inherited from CLAUDE.md and
`docs/WEB-DESIGN.md`. The TV build is the **same** `watch.js` / `watch.css` PWA
plus a TV layer — not a fork, not a framework rewrite. **Norigin Spatial
Navigation and every other React-based focus library are therefore out**; the
focus engine is ~200 lines of our own vanilla JS.

**7.2 The focus engine (binding shape).** A single module owning: a registry of
focusable elements, a spatial "nearest in direction" resolver over
`getBoundingClientRect()`, roving `tabindex`, `scrollIntoView` on focus change,
and one `keydown` listener. Views register and unregister their focusables on
`showView()` — the same lifecycle discipline that already governs
IntersectionObservers (CLAUDE.md).

**7.3 Per-platform shims only (binding).** The differences between webOS, Tizen
and VIDAA are **key codes, lifecycle events, and packaging** — nothing else. Each
lives in a small adapter; no view code may branch on platform.

| Concern | webOS | Tizen |
|---|---|---|
| Back | `keydown` keyCode **461** | `tizenhwkey` event |
| Media keys | standard `keydown` | `tizen.tvinputdevice.registerKey()` first |
| Lifecycle | `webOSLaunch` / `webOSRelaunch` | `visibilitychange` |
| Pointer | Magic Remote cursor — **must coexist** with D-pad focus | none |
| Package | `.ipk` via `ares-package` | signed `.wgt` via `tizen package` |

**7.4 Magic Remote coexistence (binding).** LG's pointer mode is not optional to
support. Hovering moves focus; the D-pad continues to work from wherever the
pointer left focus. Two input models, one focus state.

**7.5 TV breakpoint, not TV fork.** The mobile-first CSS gains a TV media query.
Existing `min-width` discipline (CLAUDE.md) is preserved — the TV layer is
additive.

**7.6 Service-worker discipline.** The TV build ships through the same versioned
SW as the web viewer. Bump the shell version on every TV change, or TVs serve a
stale app for days (`web-platform-patterns`).

## §8 — Anti-patterns (never)

- ❌ Shipping the phone/tablet layout with bigger fonts and calling it a TV app.
- ❌ A focusable element with no visible focus state, or a screen with no initial
  focus.
- ❌ Intercepting Back, or exiting to the launcher from mid-playback.
- ❌ A custom scrubber or custom transport over a platform player (Decision 037).
- ❌ Background media controls / Now Playing on a TV video app (TV-NP, §5.4).
- ❌ `TvLazyRow` and friends (§6.1) — removed from the platform.
- ❌ A React or framework dependency in the web-TV build (§7.1).
- ❌ Any browse path that requires typing (§3.6).
- ❌ An opaque "recommended for you" row (§1.4).
- ❌ Forking the Android app for TV, or forking the web app for TV.

---

## §9 — The three tests (run before any TV surface ships)

1. **The remote test.** Unplug every input but the D-pad. Can you reach and
   operate *every* function of the surface, and get back out? (§1.3, §3.4)
2. **The ten-foot test.** Sit back — or shrink the screenshot to 25%. Can you
   tell what is focused, and read the primary text? (§3.2, §4.3)
3. **The parity test.** Is this verb already defined for another platform in
   PARITY.md? If yes, implement *that verb* in this idiom. If no, it needs an IA
   rule in tvOS-DESIGN §2 first — a TV build never invents a top-level surface.

---

## §10 — Out of scope (deliberate, for the first TV wave)

- **Clip Studio / Creation Studio** — permanently out (§2).
- **Sign-in and cross-device sync** — no CloudKit off Apple; Google Drive App
  Data sync is the Android-family path (Decision 028) and is deferred past the
  first TV wave. TV state is local until then.
- **Platform home-screen integration** — Google TV channels, Fire TV catalog
  integration, Roku Continue Watching. All are v2, all constrained by §1.4.
- **Roku** — a separate funded decision (Decision 047); no code here applies.

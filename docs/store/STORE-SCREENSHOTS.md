# Store screenshots — what we show, and how we capture it

Binding for every store listing. Two halves: **§1 the screen set** (what earns a
slot and why) and **§2 the playbook** (how a capture run is driven end to end).

---

## §1 — The screen set

### R-SHOT-1: every screenshot shows a FREE feature

**No Club feature appears in any store screenshot on any platform.** Not the hub,
not Link Wall, not Marathon, not Expeditions, not the Knowledge Atlas, not the
Story Archive, and never the paywall.

*Why:* the same reasoning as R-CLUB-1 (iOS-DESIGN §5.2a). A store listing is the
first impression, and a shopper counts locks. Tidbits' actual pitch is *"the
world's best trivia app with the least amount behind a paywall"* — a listing that
leads with premium features tells the opposite story, and it is the story a
shopper believes before they ever install. The free game is the product; Club is
a layer some people buy later.

*How to apply:* capture with the Club flags OFF (never `TIDBITS_CLUB=1`) — the
capture script refuses to run if one is set. No Club *feature* may appear.

**One deliberate exception:** the Home shot shows the single quiet Club row,
because it is part of Home and cannot be scrolled out of a simulator capture.
That is acceptable — and arguably load-bearing — because the row's own copy is
*"Six optional extras for getting better. Everything else in Tidbits is free."*
It states the pitch rather than undermining it. A Club row is fine; a Club
*feature*, a lock icon, a CLUB chip or a price is not.

### R-SHOT-3: a store frame is never a random draw

**Gameplay screenshots use a screened, deterministic question set — never whatever
the corpus hands back.**

*Why:* a random draw put a Holocaust question into the Windows reveal slot, the
single most-viewed frame in a listing. **The owner has ruled that question fine
in the app** (2026-07-30) — the corpus covers hard history on purpose, and that is
not a content problem. This rule is a *listing* decision only: a storefront
thumbnail is seen out of context by people who have not chosen to play, so the
set is curated rather than rolled. It implies nothing about the questions
themselves, and the blocklist must never be reused as an in-app filter.

*How to apply:* the Windows renders (`StoreScreenshots.SafeQuestions`) exclude a
blocklist of atrocity/violence terms across prompt, options and explanation;
require a Wikipedia-lead-style explanation, because a restatement ("The elevation
of X is about 313 m.") differentiates nothing in the slot whose whole job is to
show you learn something; and take at most one question per category and per
prompt-shape, because a purely id-ordered pool produced ten near-identical "which
was born first?" questions.

**Every platform now screens.** `Core/Store/ScreenshotQuestions.swift` and its
Kotlin mirror apply the same word list and selection rules as the Windows
renders, wired behind `TIDBITS_SCREENED` (Apple) and `--ez tidbits_screened`
(Android) and set for every capture. Still eyeball a re-run — the screen is a
blocklist, not a judgement — but it is no longer a dice roll.

### R-SHOT-2: the first three slots carry the pitch

Most shoppers see three thumbnails. The order is fixed:

1. **Home / Quick Play** — one tap into a real game.
2. **A question** — the core loop, legible, no chrome.
3. **The reveal and its story** — the payoff, and what makes Tidbits a *learning*
   game rather than a quiz app. This is the differentiator; it never slips below
   slot 3.

### The canonical eight

| # | Screen | What it proves | Free? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Home — Quick Play hero | one tap to play; breadth without a wall | ✅ |
| 2 | Question in play | the core loop reads cleanly at thumbnail size | ✅ |
| 3 | Reveal + "the story behind the answer" | you *learn*, not just score | ✅ |
| 4 | Daily Tidbit | the habit — everyone gets the same 7 today | ✅ |
| 5 | Records — your knowledge by domain | progress you own, free | ✅ |
| 6 | Trivia Night | host or join a real night with friends | ✅ |
| 7 | Pass & Play / Online Multiplayer | social, on one device or against a real player | ✅ |
| 8 | Create a quiz from any topic | make your own from the whole of Wikipedia | ✅ |

### Per-platform sets

Same verbs, native idiom — and a platform never ships a screen it doesn't have.

| Platform | Screens | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **iPhone** | 1–8 | the reference set |
| **iPad** | 1–8 | same, in the wide layout |
| **Apple TV** | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 | no Create (typing on a remote is hostile — PARITY 🚫) |
| **Mac** | 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8 | drops Pass & Play (a touch/couch verb) |
| **Android phone** | 1–8 | mirror of iPhone |
| **Android tablet** | 1–8 | Play requires a tablet set for tablet-eligible listings |
| **Windows** | 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8 | mirrors the Mac set |

### Store sizes

| Store | Slot | Pixels | Captured on |
|---|---|---|---|
| App Store | iPhone 6.9" | 1320×2868 | iPhone 17 Pro Max (iOS 26.5) |
| App Store | iPad 13" | 2064×2752 | iPad Pro 13-inch (M5) |
| App Store | Apple TV | 3840×2160 | Apple TV 4K 3rd gen |
| App Store | Mac | 2560×1600 | the Mac app, window pinned to 1280×800 @2x |
| Google Play | Phone | 1080×2400 | Pixel 9 Pro emulator |
| Google Play | Tablet | 1600×2560 | Tablet_10 emulator |
| Microsoft Store | Desktop | 1366×768 | Avalonia headless render on `windows-latest` |

Apple accepts up to 10 per slot, Play up to 8, Microsoft up to 10. Eight is the
target everywhere — enough to tell the story, few enough that every one earns it.

## §2 — The autonomous playbook

`tools/capture-screenshots.sh (ported; adapt hooks per app)` runs a whole platform unattended. It leans on the
`DebugHooks` env family (CLAUDE.md, *"Drive the app to a known state for
screenshots"*), so no screen needs a human tap.

```bash
tools/capture-screenshots.sh (ported; adapt hooks per app) ios       # iPhone 6.9"
tools/capture-screenshots.sh (ported; adapt hooks per app) ipad
tools/capture-screenshots.sh (ported; adapt hooks per app) tvos
tools/capture-screenshots.sh (ported; adapt hooks per app) macos
tools/capture-screenshots.sh (ported; adapt hooks per app) android
tools/capture-screenshots.sh (ported; adapt hooks per app) android-tablet
tools/capture-screenshots.sh (ported; adapt hooks per app) all       # every Apple + Android target, in order
```

Output lands in `branding/store-screenshots/<platform>/NN-name.png`, numbered in
listing order so an upload is a drag of the whole folder.

### The hooks each shot uses

| Shot | Hook set |
|---|---|
| 1 Home | *(none — cold launch)* |
| 2 Question | `TIDBITS_AUTOPLAY=classic:mixed` |
| 3 Reveal | `TIDBITS_AUTOPLAY=classic:mixed` + `TIDBITS_AUTOPILOT=1` + `TIDBITS_AUTOPILOT_STEPS=1` |
| 4 Daily | `TIDBITS_AUTOPLAY=daily:mixed` |
| 5 Records | `TIDBITS_TAB=records` + `TIDBITS_SEED_RECORDS=24` |
| 6 Trivia Night | `TIDBITS_NIGHT_SETUP=1` |
| 7 Pass & Play | `TIDBITS_PARTY=1` (Apple/Android) |
| 8 Create | `TIDBITS_AUTOCREATE=<topic>` |

`TIDBITS_AUTOPILOT_STEPS=<n>` exists for shot 3: plain autopilot advances every
0.9 s, which is far too tight to catch the reveal with a `sleep`. With `STEPS=1`
autopilot submits exactly one answer and then **stops**, parking the app on the
reveal for as long as the capture needs. `STEPS=0` parks on the unanswered
question. Both are no-ops in production.

Every run also sets `TIDBITS_NO_GAMECENTER=1` — GameKit's full-screen "Welcome to
Game Center" sheet otherwise covers the app on a signed-out simulator and every
frame comes back useless.

### Rules the script enforces

- **Never `TIDBITS_CLUB=1`** (R-SHOT-1). The script refuses to run if it is set
  in the environment.
- **Seed before Records.** An empty Records tab shows the empty state, which is
  honest but sells nothing; `TIDBITS_SEED_RECORDS` writes synthetic games only
  when the store is empty and never touches real data.
- **Verify every frame.** After each capture the script asserts the PNG is the
  expected pixel size and is not >99% one colour (which is what a splash screen,
  a black frame, or a covered window look like). A failed frame fails the run
  loudly rather than shipping a blank.
- **One simulator at a time.** Booting two wedges both (CLAUDE.md).

### Manual legs

- **Windows** renders through `windows-repl.yml` (there is no local Windows box —
  Decision 045). Run the workflow, download the artifact, drop the PNGs in
  `branding/store-screenshots/windows/`.
- **macOS** drives the real app on this Mac (there is no Mac simulator), so it
  needs a logged-in desktop session. Three things it has to get right, each
  learned from a failed run:
  1. Capture the app's **window by id** (`tools/mac_window_id.py` →
     `screencapture -l`), never a screen rectangle — a rectangle capture put the
     Android emulator window into the middle of several frames. The window owner
     is **"Tidbits"** (the display name), not the process name.
  2. Dismiss the keychain prompt the ad-hoc signature provokes. Window capture
     already keeps it out of the frame, but it steals focus.
  3. Target **2560×1600**, not 2880×1800: the window is clamped to the display's
     visible frame (872pt here, after the menu bar and Dock), so 1440×900 of
     content is unreachable without changing the user's Dock settings.

- **Windows** renders on `windows-latest` — there is no local Windows box
  (Decision 045):

  ```bash
  gh workflow run windows-repl.yml -f test_filter="FullyQualifiedName~StoreScreenshots"
  gh run download <id> -n windows-repl-artifacts -D /tmp/win
  cp /tmp/win/store/*.png branding/store-screenshots/windows/
  ```

  Every shot renders the real `MainWindow` shell, not a bare `UserControl` — a
  first attempt hosted the views directly and the content collapsed into a narrow
  left column against a huge empty field, because these views are designed to
  live inside the `FANavigationView`. And it renders at **1366×768**: at 1920×1080
  the ~760px content column beside the ~200px nav left half the frame empty.

  Re-render on Windows rather than reusing a Mac run: Skia rasterization and font
  fallback are not identical, and the listing must match what a Windows user sees.

# In-app purchases across stores — the release choreography

Launching one paid tier on Apple + Play + Microsoft simultaneously is a
COORDINATION problem before it is a code problem. Every rule below is a
lesson a real multi-store IAP launch paid for (Tidbits Club, 2026 — three
products on four store fronts). The per-store API traps live in Decision 039;
the client-side empty-products diagnosis lives in `IAP-TROUBLESHOOTING.md`.
This doc is the sequencing.

## The critical path is financial, and it is OWNER-ONLY

Nothing returns products until the money paperwork is done, and it fails
silently — the store answers success with zero products, which looks exactly
like a broken client:

- **Apple**: the Paid Applications agreement (Agreements, Tax, and Banking)
  must be Active. Until then, App Store Connect returns NOTHING for every
  product of every app on the account.
- **Play**: a payments profile must be linked before products activate.
- **Microsoft**: the payout + tax profile lives under gear → Account settings
  and is visible ONLY to the account-owner identity — it does not exist in
  the UI for the CI/Entra identity, so an agent cannot even see whether it's
  done. Paid add-ons will not certify without it.

Put these at the TOP of the OWNER list at the start of the monetization
phase, not when the paywall renders empty.

## Rule 1 — An IAP product rides in exactly ONE review submission

On Apple, a new in-app purchase / subscription attaches to a specific app
review submission, and it can be attached to only one at a time. If iOS,
macOS, and tvOS submissions are all in flight, the products ride ONE of
them — the other platforms' reviews see an app referencing products that
are not in their submission, and either starve (products never approve for
that platform) or bounce.

**Ship serially until the products are approved once**: submit the platform
that carries the products, wait for approval (products go Approved
account-wide), then submit the remaining platforms. After that first
approval, parallel submissions are fine again.

## Rule 2 — "Ready to Submit" means it was NEVER submitted

A product state of *Ready to Submit* is not a queue position; it means the
product has never been attached to any submission. The check that tells the
truth is the review submission's ITEM LIST (App Store Connect → the
submission → items), not the product's state page. A launch shipped with
the app approved and the products still sitting in Ready to Submit —
because nothing ever attached them — renders a paywall with zero products
in production.

Before submitting an IAP-bearing release: open the submission, confirm the
products are listed as items IN it.

## Rule 3 — Per-platform settings exist; verify every platform separately

App Store Connect settings you'd assume are app-wide can be per-platform.
The License Agreement (standard EULA vs custom) is set PER PLATFORM — set
on iOS, unset on macOS/tvOS, and the non-iOS submissions carry the wrong
terms. After changing any listing-level setting for a subscription launch,
walk EACH platform's page and confirm it took.

## Rule 4 — The store's empty answer has two different meanings

`products(for:)` (and its Play/Windows equivalents) fails two ways: the
call THROWS (connectivity/entitlement — the client's problem), or it
SUCCEEDS WITH AN EMPTY LIST (the store answered; the account/product state
is the problem). The paywall must render these differently and log which
one happened, or every backend-side cause gets debugged as a client bug.
Full diagnosis tree: `IAP-TROUBLESHOOTING.md`. Retry the empty case on a
cold launch — App Review hit a cold-start empty that a single retry with
backoff fixed (a real rejection).

## Rule 5 — The query layer is per-store; the entitlement model is shared

Decision 039 in full. Play Billing: one query PER product type (mixed
INAPP+SUBS throws, main-thread, only on a real Play-provisioned device).
Microsoft: ONE query for everything (`GetAssociatedStoreProductsAsync`; a
subscription is a `Durable` add-on — filtering by a "subscription" kind
returns nothing, silently). Apple: one `products(for:)` with all ids. Write
each from that store's docs; never port a sibling's shape.

Shared across all of them: the entitlement gate FAILS OPEN (a plumbing
error can never lock out a paying customer), and every store's product ids
are verified by reading them back from the store's own API — not by
trusting the constants in the code (`windows-store-addons.yml` is the
Windows read-back; `asc` API listing works for Apple; Play's console for
Android — no Play API lists them cleanly either).

## Rule 6 — Purchases are only testable on each store's REAL provisioning path

Every store has a gap no local run can cross:

| Store | Local run shows | Only the real path shows |
|---|---|---|
| Apple | Xcode StoreKit config (scheme-attached — TestFlight and home-screen launches bypass it) | TestFlight/production against real ASC state |
| Play | Emulators cannot see Play Billing AT ALL | A physical Play-provisioned device (Firebase Test Lab works: `tools/testlab-android.sh`) |
| Microsoft | `StoreContext` refuses unpackaged processes; CI has no Store identity | The certified MSIX installed FROM the Store |

Plan an owner verification pass on each store's real path after each
platform's release goes live — it is the last unverifiable-from-CI step,
every time.

## Rule 7 — Deletion must cover the paid state too

Account deletion (a review requirement — Decision 035) interacts with IAP:
deleting an account must not orphan a paid entitlement silently, and the
deletion must be verified by READING THE RECORD BACK (a backend "delete"
that writes null can be a no-op that review catches). The anonymous
account holds entitlements too.

## The launch-order checklist

1. OWNER: financial agreements on every store (top of the phase).
2. Products created on every store; ids identical where the stores allow.
3. Client queries written per-store (Rule 5), gated fail-open.
4. Read-back verification of ids from each store's API.
5. Apple: attach products to ONE platform's submission; ship it; wait.
6. Remaining Apple platforms + Play + Microsoft, serially or parallel per
   Rule 1; per-platform settings walked (Rule 3).
7. Owner purchase-verification on each real provisioning path (Rule 6).
8. PARITY.md: the paywall, the entitlement gate, AND the restore/manage
   surface each get a row per platform.

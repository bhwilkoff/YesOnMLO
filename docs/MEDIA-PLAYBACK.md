# Media Playback & Captions — the streaming doctrine, paid for in full

Distilled from Archive Watch's 2026 campaigns (Decisions 021–081 there):
streaming public-domain video from archive.org to five platforms, then
captioning it live on device. The `resilient-media-streaming` skill carries
the core loader pattern; this doc carries everything the campaigns taught
beyond it. Media apps only — skip otherwise. Incident names refer to Archive
Watch, where the full write-ups live in `docs/decisions/`.

## 1. The resilient loader (the settled core)

When streaming from hosts you don't control (archives, rotating storage
nodes, idle-connection resets), own the connection: a resource-loader
delegate (Apple `AVAssetResourceLoaderDelegate` / Media3
`LoadErrorHandlingPolicy`) that serves ranged requests with a SHORT idle
timeout, resumes from the exact byte offset on any reset (never restart at
0 — the player flushes its whole buffer otherwise), streams bytes as they
arrive (never whole-chunk), pins the post-redirect storage node, and fails
over across the host's published alternate nodes on hard errors only
(5xx/403/404 — a timeout is the expected idle drop, never a health signal).
Diagnostics are permanent but env-gated. No bitrate ceiling: resilience is
what makes full-quality files safe.

Hard-won refinements to the core:

- **A block cache for badly-muxed files**: a long interleaved upload makes
  the player fetch tiny random sample chunks, each paying full request
  latency — an effective 3–4 Mbps ceiling on a 100 Mbps node. Serve small
  bounded reads from aligned ~2 MB cached blocks with an LRU sized to the
  playhead's working set (~50 MB; an 8-block cap thrashed).
- **Two decoder cursors read the same bytes** — audio and video walk an
  interleaved file separately; without a shared cache every byte is fetched
  2–3×. Only visible on a throttled network (see §5).
- **Start within a hard budget or fall back**: viewers leave at ~30 s. If
  the source cannot serve the file's bitrate at all (measured: a 5.7 Mbps
  file served at 2 Mbps), fail over to a pipeline-vetted same-title smaller
  copy — identity vetted at BUILD time, never fuzzy-matched at runtime.
  Mid-film failures never switch copies; resume position survives the
  rebuild. And never add a "slow chunk" watchdog with a throughput floor —
  it was shipped and reverted twice (a 5.6 Mbps floor killed normal Wi-Fi;
  a 0.2 Mbps floor killed slow startup probes); the idle timeout already
  covers dead connections.
- **Host-wide connection discipline**: hammering one host's MAIN endpoints
  (metadata/images) rate-limits the whole IP and breaks even unrelated
  playback in the household. Cap connections per host, share sessions,
  never use the default shared session or a bare `AsyncImage` for grids.

## 2. The custom loader disqualifies native features — know the list

A custom scheme/loader means the receiving process cannot fetch your media.
Measured consequences, each a shipped bug:

- **Video AirPlay does not work** (Apple's own position). On route-engage,
  swap the item to a published receiver-fetchable URL; restore the loader
  on disengage. Route ALL such swaps through one helper that CHECKS the
  scheme — new loaders must not be addable without the AirPlay check
  learning about them. Same class: Google Cast needs an https URL the
  receiver can fetch (a `blob:` track is document-scoped and invisible to
  it), and Roku's `Video` node owns networking outright.
- **OS-generated captions may not flow through a loader** (below).
- File-reading APIs (`AVAssetReader`, export sessions) refuse remote and
  custom-scheme assets entirely.

## 3. HLS + subtitles: the shapes that work and the bombs

Side-load subtitles as tracks; never re-encode video for them.

- Apple cannot side-load a sidecar VTT onto a progressive MP4 — the native
  path is a synthesized HLS master (video + subtitle renditions). The
  loader may serve playlists, keys, and the VTT itself; **the media segment
  must stay a direct https URL** (a custom-scheme segment fails
  CoreMediaError -12881).
- A local `file://` HLS master referencing anything remote NEVER plays —
  it sits at `.unknown` forever with an empty error log. Serve local
  playlists through the loader too.
- **The single-segment memory bomb**: a one-segment HLS wrapper around a
  feature-length MP4 makes the whole film the player's atomic buffering
  unit — a low-RAM device's media server dies mid-film (-11819), the
  silent rebuild leaves an UNDEAD player (pause() does not stop a
  pipeline; only `replaceCurrentItem(nil)` does), and the double pipeline
  is your "stutter and repeated lines." On constrained devices, render the
  subtitle file in your own overlay over the plain resilient stream
  instead.
- Fix mistimed subtitle files AT THE SOURCE (pipeline re-time), the only
  route by which platforms without on-device speech get correct timing.
  Two distinct fault classes need two tools: a constant offset (audio
  alignment) and framerate DRIFT — a file whose last cue ends after the
  film is PHYSICS-provably wrong; a 23.976/25 rescale repairs the telecine
  subset. Detect on physics, never on pattern.

## 4. Live captions on device (Apple speech stack)

If you caption uncaptioned media with `SpeechAnalyzer`:

- **Transcribe AHEAD of playback with a second muted scout player at 2×**,
  tapped via `MTAudioProcessingTap` — tapping the playing item can only
  trail the speech. Scale cue times by the scout rate; map analyzer time
  to media time by `offset + t × rate`, never by tap timestamps (they're
  film-time on macOS and compressed-time on tvOS). Pin
  `audioTimePitchAlgorithm` explicitly; drop tap buffers whose timestamps
  rewind; the display loop follows the CURRENT player and runs until
  cancelled.
- **The scout is an economy**: it earns bandwidth only after playback has
  banked buffer (start-gated), yields on depth hysteresis (not a
  fired-too-late health flag), resyncs by SEEKING (never rebuilding), and
  SURRENDERS when it mathematically cannot keep up — saying so once.
- **`AssetInventory.status(forModules:)` is the only honest capability
  signal.** Platform-SDK presence, `supportedLocale(equivalentTo:)`, and a
  granted `reserve` all mislead on model-less devices. Gate every caption
  surface on it; never advertise a feature the device cannot run.
- **Offered ≠ selected ≠ emitting.** An available caption track proves
  nothing: select it, then require EMITTED TEXT before trusting it — this
  conflation shipped four separate wrong fixes. Judge published subtitle
  files against your own transcript (word PRESENCE near expected time
  swept over offsets — never sequence alignment), with evidence floors
  scaled to the verdict's cost: condemning a human file needs 100+ heard
  words; a shift smaller than the judge's own noise (~1.5 s) is adopted
  only on dense agreement; no-verdict must stay reachable — absence of
  proof of a match is not proof of a mismatch.
- **Caption display rules**: cues never overlap (push the later one), are
  held for reading time (~2.5 words/s) divided by character count, and a
  drift correction may never rewind the schedule past the viewer's
  playhead — late text can still be read; text for a moment already passed
  cannot.
- **Never ship machine transcription of unknown audio as subtitle FILES**
  — on poor archival audio it hallucinates coherent nonsense, and a wrong
  subtitle is worse than none. (Whisper was built, shipped, and torn out.)
  Live on-device captioning the viewer opted into is different: it's
  labeled, ephemeral, and better than a blank screen.

## 5. How this domain is verified

All of `docs/DEVICE-HARNESSES.md` applies with force here, because every
one of these bugs was invisible to logs: ship gates run on RELEASE builds
through a throttled range server (~10 Mbps — stock `http.server` ignores
Range and feeds players garbage); localhost-served copies are the control
arm that exonerates file/network/server in one run; instruments must never
perturb the pipeline (an audio watchdog that re-attached its tap
MANUFACTURED the dropouts it reported); and the verdict is the glass — OCR
of on-screen captions against the source file, tap-metered audio — never
the player's own state flags.

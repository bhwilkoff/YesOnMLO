# This is the replacement for Play's Pre-launch report, which never generated for this
# app on either the internal or the closed track. It is the same engine underneath, it
# just takes a CLI, and it works on the free Spark tier.
#
# Why it is not optional (Decision 055): an emulator and a Test Lab VIRTUAL device have
# no Play Store, so they cannot see Play Billing, Play Integrity, Play Games, or a vendor
# OS skin. Version codes 75 and 85 were both rejected for "the app opens, but it keeps
# crashing" and both passed every local test; a single Robo run on a physical Galaxy A03s
# produced the actual stack in four minutes.
#
#   tools/testlab-android.sh              # default matrix (physical only)
#   tools/testlab-android.sh --quick      # one device, for a re-verify after a fix
#   tools/testlab-android.sh --apk path   # skip the build, test an existing APK
#
# Free-tier quota is a handful of PHYSICAL device-tests per day and the matrix is
# rejected wholesale when it would exceed it (TEST_QUOTA_EXCEEDED) — so --quick exists
# to leave headroom for the verify run after a fix.

A row reading "Application crashed" has its stack waiting in the GCS bucket printed
above, NOT in this output:

  gcloud storage ls   "gs://<bucket>/<run>/<device>/"
  gcloud storage cp   "gs://<bucket>/<run>/<device>/data_app_crash_0_com_example_appname.txt" .

"Infrastructure failure" and "Test failed to run" are Test Lab's own flake — confirm
by checking the device logcat for our package before treating either as a real defect.

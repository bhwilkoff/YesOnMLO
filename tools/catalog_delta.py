"""Turn any catalog-mutating tool into a lock-free one, without changing it.

THE PROBLEM, measured. Twenty-seven workflows hold the single `catalog-writers`
lock for their ENTIRE run — fetch, compute for up to four hours, publish — and
their average demand adds up to **24.2 hours per cycle** against a lock that has
24 hours a day to give. It is oversubscribed, which is why runs are destroyed in
the queue routinely rather than occasionally (Decision 057), why budgets have to
be measured in hours, and why a kill discards a whole run's work.

The compute needs no lock. Only the mutation does, and the mutation takes about
two minutes.

Converting each tool to emit deltas by hand is ~27 bespoke changes. This does it
generically instead, by observing what a tool DID rather than asking it to
report:

    snapshot   before the tool runs      — record every item's field values
    extract    after the tool runs       — diff, emit only what changed
    apply      in a short, locked job    — merge onto a FRESHLY fetched catalog

The merge is what makes it safe. Republishing a whole catalog read hours earlier
silently reverts anything another writer published meanwhile — which the lock
was compensating for. A field-level merge does not: two workflows touching
different fields of the same item both survive.

Usage in a workflow:

    # compute job — NO catalog-writers lock
    python tools/catalog_release.py fetch
    python tools/catalog_delta.py snapshot --out /tmp/before.json
    python tools/<any existing tool>.py ...        # unchanged
    python tools/catalog_delta.py extract --snapshot /tmp/before.json --out deltas.json
    # upload deltas.json as an artifact

    # apply job — holds catalog-writers, runs in ~2 minutes
    python tools/catalog_release.py fetch
    python tools/catalog_delta.py apply --deltas deltas.json
    python tools/catalog_release.py publish

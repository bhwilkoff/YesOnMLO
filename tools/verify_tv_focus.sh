# Android TV focus verification — drive real surfaces with a real remote and
# assert that focus actually lands on real content.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# On a TV, focus IS the interaction model, and it is INVISIBLE to a screenshot.
# During this build a screenshot showed a perfectly-rendered Channels EPG that
# could not be reached by remote at all, and separately showed a "broken"
# Surprise grid that was working fine. Compiling proves nothing here either —
# `.clickable` compiles, renders, and is simply unreachable by D-pad.
#
# So: route straight to a surface (no counting D-pad presses, which lands on the
# NEAREST item and repeatedly steered checks to the wrong screen), turn on the
# focus trace, press keys, and assert on what actually took focus.
#
#   ./tools/verify_tv_focus.sh                # all surfaces
#   ./tools/verify_tv_focus.sh home browse    # a subset
#
# Requires a booted Android TV emulator/device (see the smart-tv skill for the
# low-RAM headless recipe) and the debug build installed.

# REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION (Tidbits Trivia). The SHAPE is the point:
# env-hook-driven captures per screen, crash detection via the pid simctl
# returned, durable capture paths, findings in a rounds table. To adopt:
# replace the TIDBITS_* debug hooks and the screen list with YOUR app's
# DebugHooks vocabulary (docs/DEVICE-HARNESSES.md, "the QA sweep").
# qa-sweep.sh — drive EVERY game mode and feature screen on a simulator and capture a PNG
# of each, so playability and feature completeness can be reviewed from the images rather
# than by clicking through 40 surfaces by hand.
#
#   tools/qa-sweep.sh ios   [outdir]     # iPhone
#   tools/qa-sweep.sh ipad  [outdir]
#   tools/qa-sweep.sh tvos  [outdir]
#
# This is a TEST pass, not the store capture (tools/capture-screenshots.sh) — it draws real
# questions rather than the screened set, because the point is to catch a mode that renders
# wrong, not to produce a listing.
#
# Every launch is independent: the app is terminated between cases so one mode's crash or
# stuck state cannot silently colour the next one's screenshot.

"""Has this build number already been uploaded to App Store Connect?

The archive is the expensive step — signing, three platforms, tens of minutes —
and ASC rejects a duplicate build number only at the END of it. A run failed
exactly that way on 2026-08-18: a dispatch went out alongside a push that had
been rejected (the remote had moved under it), CI checked out a tree without
the version bump, and spent the whole archive rebuilding an already-uploaded
946 before being told no.

Exit 1 when the version/build pair is already on ASC, so the workflow can stop
in seconds instead of at the end. Never fails the build on its own account: if
ASC cannot be reached, it says so and exits 0 — a guard that blocks shipping
because it could not check is worse than no guard.

Usage: python3 tools/asc_build_exists.py <marketing_version> <build_number>

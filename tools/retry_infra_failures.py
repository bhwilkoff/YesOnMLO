"""Re-run workflow runs that GitHub's hosted-runner fleet never actually started.

Runner-allocation failures — "The job was not acquired by Runner of type hosted even
after multiple attempts", or a bare "Set up job" failure — are GitHub-side infrastructure
faults, not faults in our code: not one step of ours ever executed. During an Actions
incident these silently drop scheduled work until the next cron tick, which for a daily
cron means a whole missed day.

This sweeper finds those runs and re-runs just their failed jobs. It is deliberately
conservative; a run is only re-run when all of these hold:

  * its conclusion is `failure` — or `cancelled` with ZERO jobs, see below,
  * every bad job got no further than "Set up job", so none of our own steps ran,
  * it has been retried fewer than MAX_ATTEMPTS times, and
  * no later run of the same workflow has since succeeded — an hourly cron heals
    itself, and re-running a stale one is pure waste.

Because "no step of ours ran" is the gate, a re-run can never repeat a side effect:
there was no side effect. A genuine code failure always shows a completed "Set up job"
plus a failing step of ours, so it is never touched here.

SUPERSEDED RUNS (the second pass). 27 workflows share the `catalog-writers`
concurrency group, several with 5.5-hour budgets, and GitHub keeps only ONE pending
run per group: a newer arrival CANCELS the older pending one. So while a long job
holds the lock, every scheduled catalog writer behind it is destroyed rather than
queued, and nothing ever retries it — the original docstring's blanket refusal to
touch `cancelled` is what left that work lost. Measured 2026-08-09: two separate
dispatches of the liveness remediation were cancelled this way within an hour, and
the workflows' own comments record 25-75% cancellation rates.

A superseded run is distinguishable with certainty, and it is not the same thing as
a human cancelling a running job: it has **zero jobs**. It never left the pending
queue, so GitHub never created one. A human (or a timeout) cancels a run that is
RUNNING, which always has jobs with steps. Zero jobs therefore means nothing was
interrupted and nothing partially applied — the same "no side effect" property the
first pass relies on.

The same displacement also happens at JOB granularity to the Decision-066 split
workflows: a run's compute succeeds, and only its short pending `apply` job is
destroyed in the queue. Every non-successful job having ZERO steps carries the
identical no-side-effect guarantee, and such a run gets `rerun-failed-jobs` —
only the displaced jobs re-run, fed by the artifact the compute banked.

Such a run is re-run only when its concurrency group is IDLE. Re-running into a busy
group would simply be superseded again and burn an attempt, so the group is read from
the workflow files on disk and checked against what is currently active. If the group
is busy the run is left alone; the sweeper ticks every 30 minutes and will get it once
the lock frees.

Env:
  GH_TOKEN          auth for the gh CLI (the workflow passes the default token)
  GITHUB_REPOSITORY owner/name; falls back to the repo of the current directory
  LOOKBACK_HOURS    how far back to sweep (default 12) — wide enough to still heal a
                    backlog after a multi-hour incident, since the sweeper's own cron
                    ticks are dropped during one too
  MAX_ATTEMPTS      give up after this many attempts of a run (default 3)
  MAX_RERUNS        cap on re-runs per sweep, so a bad day cannot become a storm (default 10)
  DRY_RUN           set to 1 to report what would be re-run without doing it

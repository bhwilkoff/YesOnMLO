# Mac App Store screenshot helper for Archive Watch.
#
# App Store requires Mac screenshots at EXACTLY one 16:10 size: 1280x800, 1440x900,
# 2560x1600, or 2880x1800 (PNG/JPEG, 1-10 shots). A raw window grab is never exactly that
# size (title bar, rounded corners, shadow), so this captures the frontmost Archive Watch
# window and FRAMES it — scaled to fit, centered on a solid brand canvas — at the exact size.
#
# USAGE (run once per screen, with the app already showing that screen):
#   1. Launch the RELEASE build of Archive Watch and navigate to the screen you want
#      (Home, a Detail page, Channels, the Creation Studio editor, the Supercut sheet, …).
#      Do NOT set any AW_CS_* / AW_START_* env vars — the store build must look like the real app.
#   2. Run:  tools/mac-screenshots.sh 01-home
#      It brings Archive Watch to the front, grabs its frontmost window, and writes
#      ~/Desktop/ArchiveWatch-Mac-Screenshots/01-home.png at the target size.
#   3. Repeat for each screen (02-detail, 03-channels, 04-studio, 05-supercut, 06-export).
#
# REQUIREMENT: the terminal/app you run this from needs macOS **Screen Recording** permission
# (System Settings ▸ Privacy & Security ▸ Screen Recording) or the grab is blank. The script
# checks and tells you if it looks empty.
#
# Tunables via env: SIZE=2880x1800 (default) | 2560x1600 | 1440x900 | 1280x800
#                   BG=#0A0A0A (canvas) ; MARGIN=0.06 (fraction of the long edge)

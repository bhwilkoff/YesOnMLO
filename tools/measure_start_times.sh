# How long does a film take to reach its first frame ON THE APPLE TV?
#
# Owner decision (D077): "Films should start within 30 seconds. Waiting longer
# than that will lose users almost every time." That promise had never been
# measured across a sample — only asserted. The first three titles measured
# gave 3.7s, >75s and >75s, so the spread is the whole story and a single
# title tells you nothing.
#
# Measures setupPlayer -> itemReady from the app's own diag, which is the
# frame the viewer waits for, not a curl of the URL.
#
# Usage: tools/measure_start_times.sh <archiveID> [archiveID...]

# AW_INTERLEAVE=1 alternates the hedged-probe arm title by title, so both arms
# meet the SAME archive.org weather. Comparing two sequential blocks does not
# work here and the numbers proved it: Yojimbo went from no-frame-in-75s to
# 5.8s within an hour, so a block-vs-block delta measures the hour. This is a
# stronger requirement than D075's repeated trials — the arms must be
# interleaved, not merely repeated.
# AW_PAIRED=1 measures EACH film under BOTH arms, back to back, alternating
# which goes first. Alternating the arm per TITLE was the first attempt and it
# is wrong for the same reason block-vs-block was: it compares different films.
# Pairing controls for the film AND keeps the two readings within a minute of
# each other, which is the only way to hold node weather roughly constant.

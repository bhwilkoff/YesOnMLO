# Capture Android TV store screenshots from a booted TV emulator/device.
#
# Google Play and the Amazon Appstore both want 1920x1080 landscape TV shots.
# The emulator's own framebuffer is already 1080p, so `screencap` output needs
# no scaling — verify with `file` rather than assuming, since a differently
# configured AVD will silently produce the wrong size and both stores reject on
# dimensions.
#
# Screens are reached by ROUTE, never by counting D-pad presses: a press lands
# on the nearest item, not a fixed one, which has repeatedly steered automated
# runs onto the wrong screen (same reasoning as tools/verify_tv_focus.sh).
#
# Usage:
#   ./tools/tv_screenshots.sh [outdir]
#
# Requires: a booted Android TV emulator (see the smart-tv skill for the
# low-RAM headless recipe) and the debug build installed.

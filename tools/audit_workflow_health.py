"""Catch the ways a workflow can be broken while reporting success.

(Incident names below refer to Archive Watch, this tool's origin repo —
they are the failure CLASSES this catches, kept as worked examples.)

Every failure found in this repo's CI has been of that kind, not a red X:

  * `word-index` logged "audio download failed" for months. The download was
    fine; a Python import was missing, AFTER it. Green, 260 minutes, 0 films.
  * `stock-index` scanned real films and indexed 0 shots, four times a day, for
    ~95 minutes a run. Green. The scene detector was never printing its results.
  * `validate-posters` was green while a spoofed User-Agent drew 429s from
    Wikimedia for 53% of what it checked.
  * `omdb-backfill` was green with an EMPTY repo secret.
  * `faststart-derivatives` fixed items, wrote the catalog, then hit GitHub's
    360-minute cap and SKIPPED every publish step. Reported as "cancelled".
  * `auto-captions` rejected every film nightly because a hosted runner has no
    speech models and never can.

A human reading a green tick learns none of that. So this reads what each
workflow's last run actually PRODUCED and flags the patterns:

  BROKEN     ran, took real time, produced nothing
  DROPPED    cancelled before any step ran (displaced in the queue)
  KILLED     died at a timeout with publish steps skipped
  DRAINED    genuinely finished its backlog but still running at full cadence
  SILENT     no yield line at all — cannot be judged, which is its own problem

Exit code is non-zero when anything needs attention, so it can gate a workflow.
